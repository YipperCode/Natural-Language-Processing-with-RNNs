Stan 
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 

Kyle
Going away? For how long?

Stan
Forever.

Chef
I'm sorry boys.

Stan
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 

Chef
Wow!

Mrs. Garrison
Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
 
Chef
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

Mrs. Garrison
I hope you're making the right choice.

Cartman
I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 

Stan
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 

Mayor McDaniels
And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you..

Jimbo
Bye-bye!

Gerald
Good-bye!

Mr. Mackey
So long!

A Man
So long, Chef!

A Sign-Holder
Good-bye, Chef!

Randy
Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!

Chef
Good-bye! ..

Kyle
Draw two card, fatass.

Cartman
Reverse to you, Jew. 

Stan
I'll get it. 

Chef
Hello there, children!

Stan
He's back!

Kyle
Yeah!

Cartman
All right! 

Kyle
Chef! I can't believe you're back!

Chef
Well, it's true.

Stan
But are you back for good?

Chef
That's right.

Mrs. Garrison
Hey everybody! Chef's back!

Patrons
What? All right! Yeah! 

Randy
Oh, finally! 

Gerald
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.

Chef
Yeah!

Mrs. Garrison
But now that you're back here, does that mean that you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?

Chef
Nnono!

Randy
Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?

Chef
That's right.

Randy
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?

Chef
That's right. Randy! 

Jimbo
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.

Chef
Thank you. Jimbo.

Randy
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.

Chef
That's right! Thank you. Good-bye- Everybody.

Townsfolk
Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye

Kyle
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.

Chef
You bet! Good-bye. Children! 

Stan
Right. Uh, see ya.

Cartman
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?

Stan
Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.

Kyle
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.

Stan
Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.

Kenny
(Yeah, me too.)

A Boy
It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me.

Cartman
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.

Kyle
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 

Clyde
You guys, you guys.

Stan
What?

Clyde
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.

Kyle
Like what?

Clyde
I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.

Stan
What??

Clyde
I gotta- I gotta go. 

Kyle
Weirdo. 

Chef
Hello there, children!

The Boys
Hey Chef.

Chef
How's it goin'?

Kyle
Good.

Chef
Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?

Cartman
Excuse me?

Chef
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.

Kyle
...Chef?? A-are you okay?

Chef
I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.

Stan
Dude, what are you saying??

Chef
I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.

Stan
...WHAT??

Det. Jarvis
Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.

Kyle
This doesn't make any sense!

Det. Jarvis
We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.

Stan
No, he's not.

Det. Jarvis
Uh huh.

Stan
No, he's not.

Det. Jarvis
Yeah, yeah he is so.

Butters
What's a pedophile?

Det. Jarvis
Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef,  so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? 

Stan
NO!

Det. Jarvis
Okay, did he touch you here? 

The Class
NO!

Det. Jarvis
Did he ever do this? How about this? 

Butters
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 

Det. Jarvis
Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? 

Kyle
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!

Det. Jarvis
Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh.

Chef
Hello there, children!

Kyle
Chef, the police are asking questions about you!

Chef
Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.

Stan
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!

Chef
Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass

Kyle
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!

Chef
I specializes in your asshole, Kyle. 

Cartman
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.

Kyle
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.

Kenny
(Like what?)

Kyle
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.

Stan
Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.

Kenny
(Yeah! I think...)

Cartman
Yeah!

Kyle
All right, come on guys!

Cartman
Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 

Butler
May I help you.

Kyle
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?

Butler
Right this way. 

Head Adventurer
Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-

Butler
Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.

Head Adventurer
Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!

Club Members
Tally ho!

Mr. Connolly
Indeed!

Kyle
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 

Mr. Connolly
What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!

Cartman
...Huh?

Marksman
We travel the world and have sex with children!

Marine
Yes, what else would we do?

Kyle
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!

Mr. Connolly
Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit.

Kyle
...Dude!

Mr. Connolly
I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!

Stan
NO!!

Mr. Connolly
No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again?  How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club? 

Stan
No! 

Kyle
Dude, what are you doing?!

Mr. Connolly
Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.  Well, so long then.

Kyle
Just what the hell is that thing?!

Mr. Connolly
What? What thing? I don't see anything.

Kyle
HA! I knew it!

Stan
Knew what?

Kyle
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!

Cartman
Oh, son of a bitch!

Chef
Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.

Stan
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.

Chef
I just like to make love up your butt.

Woman
Oh my God!

Nurse
Mr. Chef, is it?

Kyle
All right, come on. 

Dr. Neeland
Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?

Kyle
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.

Dr. Neeland
Brainwashed.

Stan
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.

Dr. Neeland
I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.

Stan
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.

Dr. Neeland
Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.

Chef
Doctor, do you have- children?

Dr. Neeland
Why, yes, I have two young boys.

Chef
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?

Dr. Neeland
You say he's never been like this before?

Cartman
No, Chef has always been super-cool.

Chef
I'm gonna make love to the children.

Dr. Neeland
He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.

Cartman
So what can we do??

Dr. Neeland
I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.

Kyle
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!

Dr. Neeland
Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?

Stan
Having sex with women.

Dr. Neeland
Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.

DJ
All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!

Chef
Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.

Stan
This isn't working.

Dr. Neeland
Well let's... give it some more time, kids. 

Stripper
Would you like to daaance???

Kyle
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.

Stripper
Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???

Cartman
Come on, bitch! Dance!

Blonde
Up yours, fatty.

Cartman
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!

DJ
All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spontaneous Bootay! 

Stan
Come on guys, we might as well go. 

Chef
God-damn!

Stan
Chef, we're leaving.

Dr. Neeland
Nono, wait. Let him go. 

Spontaneous Bootay
Come here, chubby. 

Chef
Wait a minute.

Stan
He's remembering.

Chef
Children! What have I done?

Cartman
It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!

Chef
I'm goinna- I'm gonna-

Kyle
Come on, Chef! You can do it!

Chef
I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!

The Boys
Yay!

Kenny
(Chef!)

Chef
Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow.

Mr. Connolly
Great shot, William! Hit him with another. 

Chef
Oh! 

The Boys
Chef!

Mr. Connolly
Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls.

Stan
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!

Mr. Connolly
He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.

Cartman
Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!

Mr. Connolly
We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!

Stan
Oh Jesus, here we go.

Mr. Connolly
Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.

Stan
We don't wanna hear it.

Mr. Connolly
You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.

Stan
Immortal.

Mr. Connolly
He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. 

Kyle
...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?

Mr. Connolly
Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?

Stan
Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.

Mr. Connolly
Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. 

Stan
We're not leaving without Chef.

Mr. Connolly
If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?

Kyle
We're not going anywhere without Chef.

Mr. Connolly
Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security!  Take these boys to the door.

Guard 1
All right, come on kids.

Kyle
No! Hey!

Mr. Connolly
Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha!

Stan
No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!

Guard 2
This is their house and they don't want you here. 

Kyle
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!

William
And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. 

Kyle
Chef, come on!

Chef
Children!

William
Get out of here!

Cartman
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!

Kenny
(Yeeeeehah!) 

Stan
Come on, Chef!

Chef
I can't... break these locks. 

Kyle
Here! 

Cartman
Run Chef!

Mr. Connolly
What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!

Kyle
Get outside! 

Mr. Connolly
Stop them! 

Chef
Children! Run! 

Mr. Connolly
Stop! 

Stan
We made it!

Mr. Connolly
Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place?? 

Stan
Chef, come on!

Mr. Connolly
You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!

Kyle
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?

Mr. Connolly
Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!

Stan
Chef, we love you.

Chef
I'm sorry children. 

Kyle
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??

Chef
Get the hell out of here, children!!

Mr. Connolly
Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO! 

The Boys
Chef! 

Chef
Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 

Stan
NO! 

Cartman
A mountain lion! 

Mr. Connolly
We can't lose another member! Shoot it! 

Chef
Ah!

Marksman
All right, this! 

Kyle
CHEF! 

Cartman
A grizzly bear!

Stan
Oh my God... They killed Chef.

Kyle
You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!

Mr. Connolly
Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. 

Cartman
Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-

Chef
POOOT! 

Cartman
Oh never mind.

Stan
Come on, let's go. 

Kyle
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.

Randy
Yeah.

Mr. Mackey
He's right. 

Kyle
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 

Mr. Connolly
Is it working? Is it working?

Tech
Yes. We've got a pulse!

Mr. Connolly
Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  We have done it! Good! Raise him up!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something.

Darth Chef
Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak?

Mr. Connolly
Yes, go on.

Darth Chef
And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?

Mr. Connolly
Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?

Darth Chef
No, I mean my balls.

Mr. Connolly
Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!

Gerald
Hey there, Richard!

Richard
Oh, hey Gerald. New car?

Gerald
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.

Richard
Well... Good for you.

Gerald
Oho...  Thanks. 

Stephen
Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.

Mrs. Garrison
Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.

Gerald
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.

Kyle
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 

Driver
Hey, is that a hybrid?

Gerald
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.

Driver
Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!

Gerald
Thanks.

Kyle
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 

Gerald
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.

Kyle
What?!

Gerald
Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler

Kyle
Dad, can we go home, please?

Gerald
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!

Kyle
But Dad, I want-

Gerald
NOW, KYLE! 

Stan
Oh hey Kyle.

Kyle
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?

Stan
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?

Kyle
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 

Randy
What's this? 

Gerald
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.

Randy
A ticket? Failure to care about the environment Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!

Gerald
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-

Randy
You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!

Gerald
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.

Randy
I know it's not a real ticket!!

Jimbo
Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 

Gerald
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.

Jimbo
Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!

Kyle
Dad, let's just go!

Gerald
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.

Randy
The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!

Gerald
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was high and mighty to  care about the earth!

Randy
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!

Gerald
Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-

Randy
There, like that! Stop that!

Darryl
Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!

Gerald
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 

Gerald
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.

Kyle
Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.

Gerald
Yes, it certainly is.

Kyle
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 

Ike
Take offense.

Kyle
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 

Ike
Alienated.

Kyle
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.

Gerald
Well, I totally agree, Kyle.

Kyle
You do??

Gerald
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.

Kyle
Righ!  Okay, good.

Gerald
And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!

Kyle
What??

Gerald
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 

Stan
Yeah? 

Butters
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.

Stan
Going away party? What do you mean?

Butters
Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.

Stan
Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!

Butters
Well he is.

Stan
Where's the going-away party?

Butters
At Cartman's house.

Cartman
Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 

Token
Hey Eric, where's Kyle?

Cartman
Who? 

Clyde
Kyle, the person leaving.

Cartman
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?

Craig
Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!

Stan
Kyle? Kyle!

Clyde
Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.

Stan
What?!

Cartman
You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!

Stan
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!

Kyle
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.

Stan
Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.

Gerald
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.

Stan
Well... Maybe they'll change.

Gerald
I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 

Stan
Nooo!

Gerald
Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 

Stan
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!

Gerald
Well? What do you think, huh? 

Sheila
Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.

Gerald
Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. 

Man
Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.

Gerald
Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.

Man
Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood?

Sheila
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.

Peter
Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.

Man 2
You in here, Peter?

Peter
Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis

Paul
Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan

Gerald and Sheila
Hello.

Paul
We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?

Gerald
Yeah. That's right.

Peter
Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner.

Gerald
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?

Peter
Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.

Paul
Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.  Ahhh,  ahh,  ahh.  We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco

Gerald
Yeah. We sure are.

Stan
Come on, people. Come on, people now. 

Cartman
Dude, what are you doing?

Stan
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.

Cartman
THAT's gay, heh.

Stan
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!

Cartman
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?

Stan
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.

Cartman
Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 

Butters
Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 

Stan
Come on, people. Come on, people now.

DJ
All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already. 

Stan
Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now

Jimbo
Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?

Jimbo
Thanks. 

Mrs. Garrison
Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? 

Randy
I know! It's like Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl

Mr. Mackey
Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?

Driver 1
Good for you!

Driver 2
Thanks!

Randy
At least we're smart enough to know better!

Driver 3
Thanks! 

Stan
Come on, everybody be people now

Speaker
And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! 

Richard
If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.

Stan
Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 

Jimbo
Great speech!

Gerald
Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.

An officer
Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song.

Stan
Yeah.

Ranger McFriendly
Uhh! 

Stan
Ow!

Ranger McFriendly
You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!

Stan
What?!

Ranger McFriendly
Come with me! 

Ranger McFriendly
There! Look! 

Stan
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.

Ranger McFriendly
Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!

Stan
Smug?

Ranger McFriendly
Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!

Announcer
This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!

Anchor Tom
It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?

Keenan
Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning.  All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country.

Singer
A smuggy day in San Francisco town.

Paul
Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?

Sheila
No! Hello, how are you?

Gail
Really good, really good. 

Gerald
Hey there. Alan, right?

Alan
Actually, it's Alain

Gerald
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?

Alan
Can I just get an empty glass?

Gerald
Oh. Sure. 

Alan
Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. 

Kyle
So... what do you do for fun?

Brian
We drink and take drugs.

Boy 1
Do you want some acid?

Kyle
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.

Boy 2
You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.

Brian
It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.

Gerald
Everything okay in here, Kyle?

Kyle
Yeah, fine, Dad.

Gerald
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.

Kyle
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.

Ike
I want three.

Stan
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!

Cartman
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!

Butters
Yeah. You're right. 

Cartman
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.

Butters
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-

Cartman
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!

Ranger McFriendly
Marsh!

Stan
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.

Cartman
Who?

Ranger McFriendly
You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!

Keenan
I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.

Cartman
The smug?

Keenan
The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  Now take a look at this. 

Stan
What is that?

Keenan
It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.

Stan
George Clooney's acceptance speech?

Keenan
Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.

Ranger McFriendly
We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!

Stan
What about San Francisco?

Keenan
Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco.

Ranger McFriendly
Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.

Randy
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?

Ranger McFriendly
If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. 

Jimbo
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!

Randy
Yeah. Good going, stupid!

Ranger McFriendly
Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.

Stephen
Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! 

Jimbo
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 

Randy
Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!

Stan
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.

Randy
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!

Ranger McFriendly
How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?

Keenan
Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.

Attendant
The hell is that? 

Butters
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.

Cartman
I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.

Butters
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?

Cartman
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.

Butters
I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.

Cartman
I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 

Ranger McFriendly
All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!

Stan
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.

Ranger McFriendly
Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!  Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!

Keenan
They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!

Man
Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.

Cartman
Butters, are you there?!

Butters
I'm here, Eric.

Cartman
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?

Butters
You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?

Cartman
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.

Butters
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.

Cartman
Turning right at O two four niner. 

Randy
That's it. That's that the last one.

Ranger McFriendly
Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!

Keenan
Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us.

Cartman
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!

Butters
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!

Cartman
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!

Gerald
Being smug is a good thing. 

Cartman
Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!

Kyle
The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.

Ike
I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.

Cartman
We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 

Network Anchor
And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.

Stan
No...

Randy
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.

Clyde
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!

Stan
What?

Clyde
It's a miracle!

Stan
Kyle!

Kyle
Hey Stan.

Stan
Dude, what happened?? 

Gerald
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.

Mr. Mackey
It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? 

Stan
Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.

Richard
So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.

Randy
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.

Gerald
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 

Kyle
NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!

Mr. Mackey
But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?

Kyle
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.

Randy
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.

Kyle
Yeah!

Randy
I'm...  I'm not ready...

Gerald
I don't think I can do it either.

Mr. Mackey
It's simply asking too much.

Randy
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.

Gerald
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 

Cartman
Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?

Kyle
Yeah, I guess so.

Cartman
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!

Kyle
Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 

Cartman
Ah, that's better. 

Sharon
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 

Randy
STAAAN!!

Stan
What?? What??

Randy
Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!

Shelly
Whats going on dad?

Randy
JUST GET THE GUN!! 

Randy
Unh, come on! 

Man
AWWWGH!

Woman
Oh nooo! 

Stan
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!

Kyle
I have no idea!

Man
Take cover in the community center again!

Jimbo
All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!

Linda
Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. 

Stephen
We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!

Stan
Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 

Randy
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 

Stan
Sso?

Randy
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.

Gerald
Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?

Randy
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!

Crowd
AWWW!

Jimbo
How could Family Guy do that?

Sheila
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?

Randy
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!

Stan
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??

Mr. Mackey
Wu-we've got the TV working! 

Tom
Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!

Sharon
Oh Randy, hold me. 

Tom
The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.  All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:

al-Zawahri
We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!

Linda
So what happens now?

Randy
We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.

Mrs. Garrison
It's okay! 

Randy
We're alive?? We're alive! 

Jimbo
Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.

Crowd
Oh thank God.

Randy
Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.

Stan
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?

Kyle
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.

Kyle
Okay you guys, check it out. 

Cartman
You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?

Kyle
Dude, it's a good show.

Stan
Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.

Cartman
Yich. 

Lois
Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner.

Peter
You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car? 

Peter
Hey there, Knight Rider. 

Michael
After those bad guys, KITT! 

Chris
Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?

Stewie
Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.

Peter
Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain? 

Peter
Pancakes for you, Captain?

Soccer Captain
I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille. 

Peter
Love will keep us together

Kyle
Hehaha, heh.

Cartman
Yich.

Lois
But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend.

Peter
Well, maybe we can just have tea.

Brian
You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? 

Peter
Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea. 

Mr. T
Try my Mr. T. ...tea. 

Peter
Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.

Kyle
That's it? That's all they did?

Cartman
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.

Stan
What? What's the big deal?

Cartman
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!

Kyle
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!

Stan
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!

Cartman
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!

Kyle
Uhhh...

Cartman
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 

Sheila
Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!

Peter
Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.

Sheila
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 

Kyle
Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!

Gerald
It's okay... it's dead.

Sheila
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!

Kyle
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.

Sheila
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!

Mrs. Garrison
Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.

Kyle
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.

Mrs. Garrison
Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.

Cartman
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.

Mrs. Garrison
Let's all look at why Muslims are upset:  First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what?  Sex. Good.  There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.  Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody?  Jack off.  Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.  And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in?  Good, sand.  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!

Cartman
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?

Wendy
...yeah.

Mr. Mackey
Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!

Stan
The hell's going on now?!

Principal Victoria
Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!

SNN Anchor
Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!

Cartman
What?

Mrs. Garrison
Why would they-?

SNN Anchor
FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say:

FOX President
Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.

Randy
FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!

SNN Anchor
Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat

al-Zawahri
Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!

Mr. Mackey
Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?

Cartman
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!

Stan
Does this mean we don't have school all week?

Cartman
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!

Kenny
(Like what?)

Cartman
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?

Stan
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.

Cartman
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.

Stan
To Los Angeles?

Cartman
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!

Kyle
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!

Cartman
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?

Kyle
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!

Cartman
All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 

Gerald
Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!

Kyle
Dad? Are you sure there's time?

Gerald
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!

Kyle
No!

Sheila
Wait a minute!  Where's Ike?!

Gerald
He was just here! Ike!

Sheila
Ike! 

Kyle
Ike? Iiike!  Ike! 

Ike
Ice cream. I want chocolate.

Kyle
Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 

Ike
Kyyyle!

Kyle
Nooooo! 

Cartman
Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 

Kyle
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.

Cartman
Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 

Kyle
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.

Cartman
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.

Kyle
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.

Cartman
You know we might not even make it into the studio.

Kyle
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.

Cartman
So what made you change your mind?

Kyle
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 

Cartman
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.

Kyle
Yeah! 

Cartman
Are you set?

Kyle
I'm set! Let's do this!

Cartman
All right, let's roll! 

Mayor McDaniels
People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!

Randy
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!

Mayor McDaniels
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.

Prof. Thomas
Thank you, Mayor.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it.

Jimbo
So how do we do that?

Prof. Thomas
We bury our heads. In sand.  We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.

Stephen
No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. 

Randy
I like the sand idea.

Mr. Mackey
Yeah, me too.

Gerald
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 

Mayor McDaniels
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!

Kyle
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.

Cartman
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.

Kyle
Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.

Cartman
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

Kyle
Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?

Cartman
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.

Kyle
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.

Cartman
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 

Kyle
You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!

Cartman
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right? Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!

Kyle
What are you talking about?!

Cartman
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

Kyle
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.

Cartman
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 

Kyle
No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!

Cartman
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?

Kyle
What?  CARTMAN! 

Cartman
Kyle, stop it!

Cartman
Holy Crap! 

Kyle
Ahhh!

Trooper
Stay on 'em!  Jesus, Mary! 

Prof. Thomas
If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own. 

Stan
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.

Randy
It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?

Stan
Yeah.

Randy
All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.

Stan
Dad, this is stupid.

Randy
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 

Jimbo
Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?

Prof. Thomas
Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.

Farmer
I'll do it.

Wife
Dylan, no!

Prof. Thomas
You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience.

Dylan
Yes, I know.

Wife
Dylan, please, you can't!

Dylan
Somebody has to do it, Sarah.  You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right.  You have to understand... I'm all she has. 

Mrs. Garrison
Who are those people?

Kyle
No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 

Cartman
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!

Kyle
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!

Cartman
Suck mah balls, Kyle! 

President Bush
Are you the network president?

FOX President
Yes, Mr. President.

President Bush
We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President.

FOX President
Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad.

President Bush
But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with.

FOX President
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 

Announcer
Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.

Cartman
This... explains everything.

Announcer
As an entire nation buries its head in sand... 

SNN Anchor
The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?

Announcer
...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged...

Cartman
Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!

Announcer
Will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? Will Family Guy be destroyed??? Will television executives fight for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out? Tune in to see Part 2 of Family Guy, next week, on South Park!

Announcer
Previously on South Park...

SNN Anchor
The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going to show the image of Mohammad uncensored!

Prof. Thomas
If we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this.

Cartman
I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.

Kyle
You just want Family Guy off the air...

Cartman
Kyle, stop it!

Cartman
So long, Kyle!

Kyle
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!

FOX President
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 

Announcer
And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Cartoon Wars... will not be seen tonight!  so that we can bring you this Terrance & Phillip Television Special 

Phillip
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy J Ranch?

Terrance
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 

Phillip
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 

Mohammad
Hey guys, how's it going?

Terrance
Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.

Mohammad
I'm here to investigate a murder.

Terrance
ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!

Phillip
You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!

Network President
Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.

Terrance
But you ruined the whole show!

Network President
Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  Aw, come on guys, give me a break.

Phillip
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy J Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!

Network President
Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!

Terrance
But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!

Network President
I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.

Cartman
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.

Receptionist
What is it regarding?

Cartman
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!

Receptionist
O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. 

Cartman
Dude, can I go before you?

Bart
Eat my shorts!

Kyle
What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 

SNN Anchor
...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America.  Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode.  Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.

Al-Zawahri
Family Guy better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. Family Guy isn't funny.

SNN Anchor
Osama bin Laden had this to say:

Osama bin Laden
If you look closely at the writing in Family Guy, you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.

SNN Anchor
Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. 

Trucker
You one of them?

Kyle
Who?

Trucker
How come your head ain't in the sand? 

Cartman
So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?

Bart
I hate Family Guy.

Cartman
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?

Bart
Not nicely.

Cartman
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.

Bart
Cool, man.

Cartman
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.

Bart
Isn't that like, terrorism?

Cartman
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.

Bart
I could do that.

Cartman
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.

Bart
I'm a pretty bad kid.

Cartman
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?

Bart
I stole the head off a statue once.

Cartman
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.

Bart
You got it, man. You got it. 

Cartman
Seeya.

President Bush
I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.

Reporters
Mr. President!

Reporter 1
Mr. President, can't the writers of the show be reasoned with? Don't they know they're putting the country in danger? 

President Bush
I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.

Reporters
Mr. President!

Reporter 1
What exactly did you learn about the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?

President Bush
I'm afraid that information is classified.

Reporters
AWWW!!!  Mr. President!

TCO Reporter
Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy writing staff not to write anything about Mohammad? 

LSX Reporter
Couldn't you throw them in prison? 

President Bush
Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!

Reporter 2
And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?

President Bush
Uh you know, the right to free speech.

Reporters
AWWW!!! 

Reporter 3
Mr. President, when your administration came up with this First Amendment, did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? 

President Bush
Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.

TCO Reporter
What do you intend to do about this First Amendment, Mr. President? 

Reporter 4
Forgive me, Mr. President, but this First Amendment sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob? 

Reporters
Yeah!

Reporter 5
That's right!

FOX President
Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.

Receptionist 2
Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode

FOX President
All right, let's get this over with. 

Cartman
Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...

Staff
Oh, poor kid.

Cartman
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..

FOX President
I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.

Staffer
Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again.

FOX President
Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.

Cartman
I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.

FOX President
Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.

Cartman
Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.

FOX President
What was that?

Cartman
I I said thank you. Thank you for listening. 

Kyle
Thanks a lot for the ride.

Trucker
Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!

Kyle
I'll do everything I can.

Trucker
I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? 

Kyle
Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?

Bart
Who wants to know?!

Kyle
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.

Bart
The network president's office is in there! 

Kyle
Oh thanks, dude.

Bart
No problem, man. 

Kyle
Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!

Bart
Cowabunga, motherfucker!

Receptionist 2
Hello Mitchell.

Mitchell
Oh hi, Miss Travis.

Miss Travis
The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the Family Guy writing staff.

Mitchell
Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.

Cartman
It won't take long, sir.  Ow...

Mitchell
All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.

Cartman
Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.

Mitchell
Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.

Cartman
Wha?  What are they?

Mitchell
They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea.

Cartman
Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.

Mitchell
They really are brilliant creatures.  You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls.  Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them.  The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank.  Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman.  The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script.  Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!

Lois
Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.

Peter
You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?

Waiter
¿Qué pasa, señores?

Gary Coleman
Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?

Cartman
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!

Mitchell
When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Keith?  All right all right, put it back in!  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.

Cartman
Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-

Mitchell
That isn't gonna work on them.

Cartman
Why not?

Mitchell
Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.

Cartman
Son of a bitch.

Kyle
Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?

Cartman
Well well well! 

Kyle
Cartman!

Cartman
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.

Kyle
You fat sun of a bitch!

Cartman
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.

Bart
Yeah.

Kyle
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!

Bart
Shut up!  You shut your fucking face, man!  Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?

Cartman
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.

Bart
Cool man!

Kyle
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!

Cartman
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.

Kyle
WHAT?!

FOX President
I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? 

Mitchell
We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.

FOX President
But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?

Mitchell
No sir, none of us did. 

FOX President
Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!

Cartman
Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.

FOX President
You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!

Executive
Twenty-five minutes.

FOX President
I gotta hurry! 

Cartman
I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!

Cartman
Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!

Kyle
Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!

Cartman
How the hell did you get out?

Kyle
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!

Cartman
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!

Kyle
You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!

Cartman
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!

Kyle
There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 

Cartman
I can't let you do that!

Kyle
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!

Cartman
Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!

Kyle
Ow. Quit it!

Cartman
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! 

Cartman
Stop it!

Kyle
Ow. Quit it!

Cartman
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!

Kyle
No more timeouts, fatass!

Cartman
Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!

Cartman
Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 

Kyle
Thanks, kid.

FOX President
Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.

Woman
What?  Mr. President, are you sure? 

FOX President
I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900. 

Computer Voice
Abort System initiated.

Programmer 1
Awaiting confirmation.

Woman
Mr. President, we need your final approval code.

FOX President
President approval code  0-0-destruct-

Kyle
Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!

FOX President
Who are you?

Kyle
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!

FOX President
The end of Family Guy?

Woman
Mr. President, we need final authorization!

FOX President
Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?

Kyle
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

FOX President
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?

Kyle
What manatees??!! 

Cartman
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!

Kyle
No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!

Woman
Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!

Kyle
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!

Cartman
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!

FOX President
Ah... I don't know who to listen to!

Cartman
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!

FOX President
Okay, I'll listen to you.  Julie?

Kyle
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!

FOX President
But he has a gun.

Kyle
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!

Cartman
Shut up, Kyle!

FOX President
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.

Kyle
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.

Cartman
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!

FOX President
I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.

Woman
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!

Kyle
Do the right thing, Mr. President.

FOX President
How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.

Kyle
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.

Cartman
No gay speeches, Kyle!

Kyle
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.

Woman
Five seconds, Mr. President! 

Kyle
Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.

Woman
Mr. President, we need a decision now!

FOX President
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.

Kyle
Yes! 

Cartman
No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 

Woman
Air it! 

Lois
Peter! You got a pink slip at work?

Peter
You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?

Peter
Coming Mohammad. 

Peter
Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks! 

Peter
Anyway, what were we talking about?

Peter
Oh yeah, my pink slip.

President Bush
Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal.

An Official
Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!

President Bush
What?!

Peter
Or the time I- 

SNN anchor
As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!

Al-Zawahri
We warned you not to show Mohammad- But Family Guy did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!

American Male 1
Hello, I am American.

American Male 2
I'm American too.

American Male 1
We like to crap own each other. 

President Bush
Hello, I am the President Bush. I will crap on both of you. 

American Male 2
Ugh! We love to crap!

American Female
I'm American. I'm pregnant with a baby, but I'm not married.

American Male 3
Let's crap. 

Jesus
Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush? 

All
Mmm, yummy yummy crap. 

Al-Zawahri
Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY.

Waiter
Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?

Head Waiter
Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.

Chris
I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!

Head Waiter
Well what about the new waiter?

Chris
The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.

Towelie
How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?

Male Diner
Will you just place our order, please?

Towelie
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

Head Waiter
Everything okay here?

Male Diner
Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!

Towelie
Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!

Male Diner
Yeah? Well you're a towel!

Towelie
You're a towel!

Head Waiter
All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired!

Towelie
Yeah!

Head Waiter
Not him, you!

Towelie
Awww.

Towelie
Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.

Towelie
A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS
By
Toweleeeie
This is a really good idea...

Publisher 1
Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Well, that's quite a fascinating story, you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness.

Towelie
Yep! And it's all true.

Publisher 1
Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.

Towelie
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.

Publisher 1
Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.

Towelie
Huh? Why not?

Publisher 1
Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels.

Towelie
Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.

Publisher 1
No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel.

Towelie
You're a towel!

Publisher 1
No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.

Towelie
Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.

Joint
But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.

Towelie
All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 

Towelie
All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.

Publisher 2
Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human being has led this kind of life, Mr...!

Towelie
McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.

Publisher 2
It's heartbreaking passages like this one: I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me. I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you?

Towelie
...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?

Publisher 2
Right, I'm sorry.  Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir.

Towelie
All right!

Oprah
Thank you so much.  Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life.  A Million Little Fibers is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie!  Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?

Towelie
Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.

Oprah
You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much,  and I think that people all over America could benefit...

Her crotch
Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!

Oprah
...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...

Her crotch
Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!

Oprah
Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!

Mingie
Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!

Oprah
And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection! 

Towelie
Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.

Oprah
Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week.

Mingie
Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!

A voice
Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.

Mingie
Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?

Gary
Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.

Mingie
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.

Gary
Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.

Mingie
She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.

Gary
Well that'll never happen.

Mingie
Not unless she gets fired.

Gary
Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?

Mingie
That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.

Gary
Ooo. How d'you know?

Mingie
I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.

Gary
'Ow do we get proof?

Mingie
We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.

Butler
Mr. Rivera.

Geraldo
What is it, Dimitri?

Dimitri
There's somebody on the phone to speak with you. He says he has inside information for you that may discredit Oprah Winfrey. 

Geraldo
Thith ith Geraldo.

Mingie
'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.

Geraldo
Who am I thpeaking with?!

Gary
'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.

Mingie
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?

Geraldo
What information do you have?

Mingie
What'd 'e say?

Gary
He wants to know what information we have.

Mingie
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you wha' 'e say?!

Gary
Stop wastin' my time.

Mingie
Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!

Gary
I didn't say stop wastin' my time, Geraldo did.

Geraldo
What ith going on here?!

Mingie
Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. 

Gary
Hallo?

Geraldo
Who ith thith?

Gary
This is Gary.

Geraldo
Gary who?! What is your last name?!

Mingie
Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.

Gary
A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.

Mingie
Aw you stupid twit!!

Gary
Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!

Mingie
He didn't call you stupid twit, I did!! Now just tell 'im this:

Gary
The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.

Geraldo
A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe.

Mingie
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.

Gary
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.

Geraldo
What proof do you have of this accusation?!

Gary
Just look into the author of A Million Little Fiyabers, and you'll discover the truth.

Geraldo
And how do I go about that?  Hello? HELLO?!

Announcer
This is Larry King Live.

Larry King
My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, A Million LIttle Fibers. How are you tonight, Steven?

Towelie
Well Larry, I'm a little high.

Larry King
Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?

Towelie
Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-

Larry King
What? What's that? Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand that we have a special report coming in. Joining us live from Afghanistan, here is Geraldo Rivera. 

Geraldo
Hello? Larry, are you receiving me?

Larry King
We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show.

Geraldo
Larry, this brave reporter has been days investigating and researching, and I have come up with a shocking discovery that is going to rock the balls and ass of the literary world! Steven McTowelie, author of A Million LIttle Fibers, is a towel!

Towelie
You're a towel.

Geraldo
No, you're a towel.

Towelie
Well you're a beaner towel.

Geraldo
What did you say??

Towelie
I'm sorry. I'm high.

Aide 1
This looks pretty bad, Oprah.

Aide 2
Your fans look to you to be all-knowing and all-seeing, and you've just spent two weeks supporting a lying racist towel.

Mingie
'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!

Gary
Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!

Mingie
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!

Gary
And her Gary too.

Mingie
Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!

Aide 2
Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do.

Oprah
What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad?

Protester 1
Your book got me to give up alcohol! But I thought you were a person!

Protester 2
Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!

Latino Protesters
¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye? ¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?

Towelie
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?

Oprah
Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?

Towelie
Why?

Oprah
We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to heighten certain things to make the book more relevant to people.

Towelie
Hey yeah.

Oprah
Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?

Towelie
Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.

Oprah
See you tomorrow.

Towelie
All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 

Joint
Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah.

Towelie
But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.

Joint
Yeah. That's why you should only get a little high.

Towelie
Well, maybe just a little high. 

Oprah
Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection. 

Mingie
Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!

Gary
Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!

Oprah
Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct?

Towelie
Yeah.

Oprah
And you are a towel.

Towelie
Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.

Oprah
Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before?

Towelie
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...

Oprah
Was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people?

Towelie
Yeah. Yeah, that's it!

Oprah
Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT!  You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!!

Man 1
That's right!

Man 2
Yeah.

Towelie
But I thought you said-

Oprah
How DARE you like to me and make me look foolish?!

Mingie
What's this? What's she doin'?

Gary
I don't understand, Mingie.

Oprah
You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?!

Man 3
Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!

Audience
Yeah!

Oprah
You will not get away with this!

Mingie
She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!

Oprah
You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America!  We are going to rise up against you!  Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?!

Audience
Yeah!

Towelie
Huh?

Oprah
Audience, if you look under your seats, you'll find your very own torches! 

Audience
Whoa.

Gary
Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?

Mingie
There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!

Gary
No!

Oprah
We'll give you a five-second headstart.  One. Two. 

Towelie
Hoooo!

Oprah
Let's get him! 

Woman
Burn him! Burn the towel!

Man 4
Burn that which lies to Oprah!

Oprah
Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you!

Man 5
All right Oprah!

Oprah
I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha?? 

Mingie
All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! 

Oprah
What the hell is this??!!

Mingie
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!

Gary
Mingie, what're you doin'?

Mingie
Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! 

Oprah
What is going on??!!

Mingie
Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!

Gary
Mingie, have you lost your mind?

Mingie
Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!

Gary
Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!

Officer
All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!

Mingie
Stay back, mate!

Officer
Drop the gun and step away.

Mingie
I'm warnin' you!

Officer
Put it down, I said-  Augh!  Gawhh 

Gary
Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!

Mingie
No turnin' back now, Gary.

Gary
Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.

Mingie
Oh keep your head, Gary.

Gary
I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! 

Mingie
Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!

Man 6
Oh my God, what are we goinna do?

Man 7
You got us into this, towel. Think of somethin'!

Towelie
All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!

Geraldo
I'm standing in the business district of central Chicago, where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage. It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's asshole may be an accomplice in this as well.

SWAT Officer 1
Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.

Mingie
Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!

Lt. Nelson
Hellow, I'm Lieutenant Nelson. What are your demands?

Mingie
I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.

Lt. Nelson
All right, how about fresh underwear for one hostage.

Mingie
I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!

Lt. Nelson
All right, we'll work on it. Don't do anything foolish.  We don't have any time; this is the most unstable vagina I've ever talked to.

SWAT Officer 2
O'Reilly, you got a shot?

O'Reilly
I got it. 

Lt. Nelson
Not with those hostages so close! It's too risky!

Gary
Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.

Mingie
Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.

Gary
Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.

Mingie
We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.

SWAT Officer 3
Oprah's vagina, this is your last warning! Put down the gun!

Mingie
If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!

Towelie
Hey wait a minute.  Pssst! 

Mingie
I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! 

SWAT Officer 4
Hostages are clear!

Lt. Nelson
All right, that's it. Take it out! 

Oprah
AAAAaaah!

Mingie
What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!

Gary
Min...  Mingie.

Mingie
Gary, what's, what's wrong?

Gary
They got me, Mingie.

Mingie
No... Oh no!

Gary
Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.

Mingie
Try to hang on, Gary!

Gary
Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge.

Mingie
Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?

Gary
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!

Mingie
I'm 'ere, Gary!

Gary
Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?

Mingie
Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.

Gary
Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?

Mingie
Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!

Gary
Tell me what you see, Mingie.

Mingie
Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.

Gary
Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- 

Mingie
Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary!  I'm comin' to see ya!

Oprah
No! Don't! 

Lt. Nelson
Oprah's going to be okay. Wish I could say the same for her vagina and asshole.

Detective
That's a great idea you had to sneak the hostages inside the bank.

Man 7
Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before.

Towelie
Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 

Joint
Youuu said it. 

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?

Kyle
Dick Cheney?

Mr. Mackey
No, the last one.

Butters
Bill Clinton.

Mr. Mackey
No, Clinton's vice-president.  He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. 

Stan
Who?

Al Gore
Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  ManBearPig. 

Kyle
ManBearPig? 

Al Gore
It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome. The end.

Mr. Mackey
Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.

Al Gore
Thank you, class. Excelsior! 

Cartman
Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.

Kyle
Just play the game, fatass!

Stan
Pass it to me, Cartman?

Cartman
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!

Cartman
All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 

Kyle
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!

Cartman
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 

Stan
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!

Beast
FOOD!  Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore.

Kyle
We know. 

Cartman
Dude, what are you doing?

Al Gore
I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.   I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the real ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?

Randy
Uhh, Stan?

Stan
Oh, hey Dad.

Al Gore
Hello.

Randy
It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?

Kyle
Okay, Mr. Marsh. 

Al Gore
Be safe. 

Randy
Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?

Stan
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.

Randy
ManBearPig?

Kyle
He's half man and half bearpig

Cartman
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.

Kyle
That doesn't make any sense.

Stan
He could be half bear, half manpig.

Randy
Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.

Stan
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.

Stan
Hello?

Al Gore
Hello, this is Al Gore.

Stan
Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.

Al Gore
I was the vice president.

Stan
I know.

Al Gore
Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.

Stan
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.

Al Gore
Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.

Stan
No, no, it's not that.

Al Gore
Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial!  I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.

Stan
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.

Al Gore
No you don't.

Stan
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.

Al Gore
Are you serial?

Stan
...Yes, I'm serial.

Al Gore
Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! 

Cartman
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?

Kenny
(Yeah, I don't get it.)

Stan
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 

Al Gore
Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?

Stan
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.

Al Gore
What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??

Stan
NO.

Al Gore
Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.

Stan
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.

Al Gore
Oh my God!  ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! 

Kyle
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.

Al Gore
Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.

Cartman
Ah I don't think so, dude. 

Kyle
Yeah, we've got school anyway.

Al Gore
I can get you all excused from school. 

Cartman
You... have that kind of power?

Al Gore
Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!

Tour Guide
Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?

Group
Yeah.

Tour Guide
Let's go cavin'. 

Tour Guide
Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.

Al Gore
Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?

Tour Guide
Ahh, no.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's...

Al Gore
All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.

Kyle
What do ManBearPig droppings look like?

Al Gore
Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.

Tour Guide
These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named The Hanging Mushroom.  And over here we have Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls.  And finally, of course, the Two Sisters.  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.

Al Gore
Groan! Groan! 

Tour Guide
Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?

Al Gore
Not yet.

Tour Guide
All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name. 

Al Gore
Kids! Kids, over here! Look.

Kyle
What?

Al Gore
I bet this is where he's hiding.  This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on!  Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! 

Tour Guide
In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. 

Group
Wow...

Woman
Take a picture of the sound, Steven. 

Stan
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.

Al Gore
Wait! Shhh.  Christ! He's here! Take this rope!  Be ready to tie him up!  I've got you now, you son of a bitch! 

Kyle
What are you doing?! 

Stan
Oh no!

Al Gore
No!

The Boys
Aaaah! 

Al Gore
Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!

The Boys
Help!

Al Gore
Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!

Tour Guide
O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Go! Go! Go out, now! 

Kyle
Hello?

Stan
Help!

Kyle
We're trapped in here!

Cartman
Somebody get us some help down hyah!

Kyle
Hello, help!

Cartman
Hello??

Kenny
(Hello!)

Stan
Help!

Kyle
Forget it! They can't hear us!

Kenny
(What are we gonna do??)

Cartman
You'd better get us out of here, asshole!

Stan
Me??

Cartman
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!

Stan
Maybe there's another way out of here.

Kenny
(Oh, no kidding.)

Kyle
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.

Cartman
This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 

Kyle
You see anything, Kenny??

Kenny
(No, nothing!) 

Kyle
Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??

Cartman
No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.

Kyle
Cartman, you okay??  You need help??

Cartman
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 

Kyle
It looks like we're completely sealed in.

Kenny
(Yeah, No shit.)

Stan
There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 

Kyle
Maybe we should go for it.

Cartman
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 

Kyle
Why?

Cartman
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.

Stan
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.

Cartman
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.

Kyle
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.

Cartman
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.

Kyle
Aw, dude! 

Miner 1
The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area. 

Miner 2
Does anybody know who these kids are?

Miner 1
No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.

Al Gore
Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!

Miner 1
What do you mean? The cave-in is over.

Al Gore
I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.

Miner 1
What's that? 

Fireman
What is that, a pigbearman?

Al Gore
No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!

Stan
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?

Kyle
They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?

Cartman
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.

Kyle
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!

Stan
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.

Cartman
All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 

Kyle
C-Cartman?

Cartman
Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?

Kyle
Dude, what are you doing?

Cartman
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?

Kyle
Dude, get away from me!

Cartman
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 

Al Gore
Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!

Miner 3
Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?

Al Gore
I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!

Miner 3
Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.

Al Gore
They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial! 

Police Officer
Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?

Miner 2
Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.

Cartman
All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 

Stan
Dude, he's really sick. 

HBC Reporter
It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.

Miner 1
All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den.

Ranger
Smuggler's Den?

Tour Guide
Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see? 

Miner 1
Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.

Kyle
Stan! Stan, wake up!

Stan
Huh? What? Have they come for us?

Kyle
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 

Cartman
Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.

Stan
Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?

Cartman
I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.

Kyle
We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.

Stan
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.

Kyle
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.

Cartman
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 

Kyle
Come on come on! Pull!

Stan
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!

Cartman
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 

Kyle
What the hell is that??

Stan
Cartman?

Cartman
You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 

Al Gore
This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!

Kenny
(We're almost there!)

Stan
I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!

Cartman
Yes you do! 

Kyle
What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 

Cartman
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!

Kyle
Ruuun! 

Miner 1
That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!

Fireman 2
You're calling off the rescue?

Miner 1
We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.

Fireman 2
Well what if the children aren't dead?

Miner 1
Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there. 

Al Gore
Nothing left alive...  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.

Stan
Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!

Cartman
Grab my hand.

Kyle
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!

Cartman
I can't kick!

Kyle
Yes you can!

Cartman
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!

Kyle
I need your help!

Cartman
No, you just have to save me. 

Stan
Kyle! No!

Al Gore
We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.

Tour Guide
Oh Jesus, here we go again. 

Al Gore
I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.

Stan
Agh.

Miner 4
Oh my God! 

Miner 1
It's the kids! 

Miner 4
They're alive! 

Al Gore
Kids! I saved you!

Stan
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!

Al Gore
Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. 

Kyle
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!

Cartman
No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.

Stan
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.

Cartman
Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 

Kyle
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?

Cartman
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!

Tour Guide 2
Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.

Cartman
That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?

Tour Guide 2
Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.

Cartman
Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!

Kyle
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!

Cartman
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!

Al Gore
Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. 

Cartman
Eh! 

Mr. Mackey
Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!

Liane
Eric, why would you do such a thing?

Cartman
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.

Mr. Mackey
You know that's not the point!

Cartman
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.

Liane
That's very naughty, Eric.

Cartman
Well he called me chubby!

Mr. Mackey
We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!

Liane
I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.

Cartman
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!

Liane
It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.

Cartman
Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!

Liane and Eric
My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.It's singing together in harmony.

Mr. Mackey
Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?

Announcer
They're every parent's worst nightmare. 

Girl
Shut up! I hate you! I hate you! 

Announcer
Kids completely out of control. 

Boy
Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!

Announcer
It's time to call Nanny 911.  We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis.  Parents of America, help is on the way!  Tonight...

Cartman
Mom, I need another energy drink! 

Announcer
This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.

Cartman
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 

Announcer
And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. 

Stella
It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! 

Cartman
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!

Liane
Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.

Cartman
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. 

Stella
Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.

Liane
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 

Stella
And you must be Eric.

Cartman
Mom, I want a Twinkie.

Liane
All, all right dear. 

Stella
Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.

Cartman
Ha! Hahahahahaha

Stella
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.

Cartman
No thanks, I'd rather naught.

Stella
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. 

Cartman
The hell do you think you're doing?

Stella
Come on.  This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed.  Eric, no! This is not acceptable! 

Cartman
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!

Stella
All right, that's it!  You're going to time-out! 

Cartman
Time out?

Stella
Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.

Cartman
And what exactly keeps me on the stool?

Stella
It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.

Cartman
Whoa, how did I do that? 

Stella
Eric, you have to stay in time-out!

Cartman
Ummm, no?

Stella
Come on, you don't have a choice.

Cartman
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.

Stella
Eric, you need to listen to me.  This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level.  Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?

Cartman
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.

Stella
Well then, I'll just have to stand right here!  Oh!  He spit in my mouth!

Liane
Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.

Stella
All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!

Cartman
Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.

Stella
Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?

Cartman
Because you took my Xbox.

Stella
Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?

Cartman
Well, yeah.

Stella
And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.

Cartman
Yeah. I guess so.

Stella
See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?

Cartman
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.

Stella
Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.

Cartman
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?

Stella
Oh, I just never had kids.

Cartman
Why not?

Stella
It... just... didn't happen.

Cartman
You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.

Stella
Why you, you...  you little bastard! How dare you?!

Liane
Eric, naughty.

Stella
What kind of  monster would-

Cartman
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 

Stella
That's it!  I'm not doing this!

Liane
Oh, but we really need some help. 

Stella
Find yourself another nanny... television show!

Announcer
Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. 

Jo
This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!

Jo
Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.

Doctor
I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.

Liane
What do you mean?

Doctor
I mean,  she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. 

Jo
From heeell! It's from heeell!

Liane
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.

Doctor
Well there... is... one more show you could still try.

Announcer
When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan.

Cesar
No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.

Liane
Please, come in.

Cesar
So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?

Liane
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.

Cesar
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.

Cartman
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.

Cesar
See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.

Cartman
Not interested I'm me?

Cesar
See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.

Cartman
Yeah, well I don't see why-

Cesar
Tsst.

Cartman
Hey!

Cesar
Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.

Cartman
Mom, this guy doesn't-

Cesar
Tsst.

Cartman
Ah! Quit it!

Liane
What what is it that you're doing?

Cesar
Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.

Cartman
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-

Cesar
Tsst.

Cartman
KNOCK IT OFF!

Cesar
Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.

Liane
Oh, that's very interesting.

Cesar
I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-

Cartman
I'm not fat!

Cesar
Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?

Liane
Well, no, I don't.

Cesar
Go on, take your son for a walk.

Cartman
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?

Cesar
See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.

Cartman
Mom, this is degrading!

Cesar
Tsst.

Cartman
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 

Cesar
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 

Cartman
Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.

Cesar
Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 

Cartman
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!

Cesar
Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.

Cartman
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?

Liane
Tsst. 

Cartman
Mom!

Cesar
Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!

Announcer
And now, back to the Dog Whisperer.

Cesar
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.

Cartman
God dammit stop ignoring me!

Cesar
You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.

Liane
Ahall right.

Cartman
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!

Liane
Tsst.

Cartman
Quit it, mom!

Liane
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.

Cesar
Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 

Cartman
Ooo, Colonel?

Cesar
I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 

Cartman
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.

Cesar
Tsst.

Cartman
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!

Cesar
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 

Cartman
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!

Cesar
We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.

Cartman
Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!

Cesar
We need him to become relaxed and submissive.

Cartman
Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?

Liane
Oh, very good, sweetie.

Cesar
Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.

Cartman
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!

Cesar
See?

Cartman
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!

Cesar
Tsst.

Cartman
You can't do that to me, I-

Cesar
Tsst. 

Cartman
Goddamnit, you just can't-

Cesar
Tsst. 

Cartman
Seriously! Ey? Eh... 

Cesar
I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.

Liane
Wow, I have a lot to learn.

Cartman
Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!

Liane
Oh dear. 

Cesar
It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.

Liane
But what if he does run away.

Cesar
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 

Butters
Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 

Cartman
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.

Stan
You can't stay here.

Cartman
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!

Kyle
You'er not staying at my house either.

Cartman
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.

Butters
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.

Cartman
Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.

Kenny
(Fuck you.)

Cartman
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 

Butters
Whoopie! G and R Railroad!

Cartman
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.

Jimmy
Who is your best friend?

Cartman
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.

Jimmy
What's my last name?

Cartman
Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.

Craig
...But I hate you.

Cartman
...Should that really matter at a time like this?

Cartman
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.

Cartman
All right, I'm back.

Liane
Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.

Cartman
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.

Liane
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.

Cartman
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.

Liane
Cesar...

Cesar
How is the painting going?

Cartman
Aw, Goddammit!

Cesar
Oh look it came back.

Liane
Yup, just like you said he would.

Cartman
What is he still doing here?!

Liane
He said he's hungry. What should I do?

Cesar
Well let's feed it.

Cartman
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!

Cesar
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.

Cartman
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 

Cesar
Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?

Liane
Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!

Cesar
Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 

Cartman
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!

Cesar
You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.

Cartman
I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-

Liane
Tsst.

Cartman
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-

Liane
Tsst. 

Cartman
Seriously! Mom-

Liane
Tsst.

Cartman
Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?

Liane
Tsst. 

Cartman
Mom?!

Liane
Tsst.

Cartman
Mom? Mom...

Liane
I did it! 

Cesar
You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. 

Liane
Oh... Oh my gosh!

Cesar
See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.

Liane
He's never done this before.

Cesar
Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.

Liane
I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 

Cesar
Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command.

Liane
Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.

Cesar
This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.

Liane
I am the pack leader! 

Cesar
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.

Liane
Sounds divine!

Cartman
Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?

Cesar
So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?

Liane
Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.

Cesar
That's greeat!

Liane
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.

Cesar
Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.

Liane
There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.

Cesar
Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.

Liane
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 

Cartman
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.

Butters
Kill your mom?

Cartman
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.

Stan
Dude, have you lost more weight?

Cartman
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.

Kyle
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.

Cartman
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.

Stan
Dude, we're not killing your mom.

Cartman
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.

Stan
Where am I supposed to get a gun?

Cartman
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!

Stan
I'm not shooting anybody.

Cartman
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.

Kyle
NO, Cartman!

Cartman
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!

Cartman
You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 

Cartman's Conscience
Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.

Cartman
No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!

Cartman's Good Side
She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.

Cartman
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.

Cartman's Bad Side
No, she's just... out to make you suffer!

Cartman
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...

Cartman's Good Side
The world doesn't revolve around me?

Cartman
Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 

Cartman's Good Side
The world doesn't revolve around me!

Cartman's Bad Side
Idiot! 

Liane
Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.

Cartman
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.

Liane
And you're studying before school?

Cartman
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.

Liane
Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.

Cartman
Tha... thank you?

Liane
I love you, sweetie.

Cartman
'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 

Liane
Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.

Cesar
How is the child doing?

Liane
Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.

Cesar
That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.

Liane
You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.

Cesar
Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.

Liane
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.

Cesar
No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 

Cartman
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 

Liane
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?

Cartman
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.

Liane
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.

Cartman
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?

Liane
Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 

Cartman
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?

Kyle
We're over here, by the cart. 

Cartman
Okay, I'm back.

Stan
Dude! We've been waiting forever!

Cartman
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!

Kyle
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!

Cartman
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!

Kenny
(I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)

Cartman
Heheh, totally, heheh.

Kyle
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 

Randy
Stan?  Stan?

Stan
H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.

Randy
Stan!

Stan
What?!

Randy
You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?

Stan
I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.

Randy
...I'm not a r-tard. 

Stan
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?

Kyle
See where I am? It's this way. 

Cartman
Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!

Kyle
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.

Cartman
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.

Stan
Oh crap! It's that guy again! 

Kyle
Who is this?

Stan
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!

Cartman
Get out of here, asshole!

Stan
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.

Kyle
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 

Stan
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!

Kyle
You bastard! 

Cartman
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 

Cartman
That sonofabitch!

Kyle
Who is that guy?

Stan
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.

Rep
World of Warcraft support line.

Stan
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!

Rep
O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.

Stan
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!

Cartman
He's a God damned butthole!

Rep
Really? That's odd.  More people calling in about their characters getting killed. 

Co-Worker
Oh no.

Rep
Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network.  Better tell the guys upstairs.

President
Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players..

Member 1
Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.

Member 2
We've got to delete him from the servers.

President
We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day.

Member 3
Jesus...

Jim
I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!

President
Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.

Jim
No...  No...  They just started playing!

Member 2
What kind of person would do this?

President
Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...haw absolutely no life.

Member 3
How do you kill...that which has no life? 

Nelson
Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?

Randy
Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.

Nelson
Is that a computer game?

Randy
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  Hello.  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 

Nelson
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 

Randy
What?? Why?? Why?!

Cartman
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.

Kyle
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!

Craig
He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!

Tweek
Mine too!

Cartman
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.

Token
Hey yeah!

Jimmy
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!

Clyde
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.

Stan
Ddue, we have to try.

Clyde
I've got better things to do.

Cartman
Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?

Clyde
I'm just gonna stop playing.

Cartman
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?

Clyde
No.

Cartman
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?

Clyde
All right all right, I'll do it!

Jimmy
So what's the p-plan?

Cartman
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!

All
To victory!

Butters
I don't play World of Warcraft.

Cartman
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!

Butters
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

Cartman
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.

Butters
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.

Cartman
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.

Token
Okay.

Jason
Got it.

Cartman
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.

Jimmy
All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.

Timmy
Timmy!

Cartman
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-

Butters
Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?

Cartman
Butters? What the hell are you doing?

Butters
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.

Cartman
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.

Butters
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-

Cartman
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!

Butters
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.

Stan
Come on, let's do this!

Craig
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.

Cartman
Then let's move out! 

Stan
Look! There he is!

Cartman
Everyone hold! 

Kyle
He's targeting us.

Cartman
Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 

Tweek
Aaaa!  I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning! 

Jimmy
Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down. 

Ike
I have poop on my pants.

Kyle
Ike, look out! 

Cartman
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!

Randy
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 

Stan
Dad??

Randy
Yeah, I'm playing from the office.

Stan
Dad, get off our teamspeak line!

Token
That's it, I'm dead!

Stan
That's it, screw this game!

Cartman
Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 

Member 3
Oh Jesus...Oh God no...

President
What?

Member 3
He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.

Member 1
How many people's characters were in there?

Member 2
Over five thousand. 

Member 1
There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?

President
Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft.

Member 5
No! Nooooooooo!

Cartman
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!

Stan
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.

Cartman
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.

Kyle
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.

Cartman
I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?

Stan
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!

Cartman
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.

Kyle
Boars?

Cartman
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.

Kyle
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?

Cartman
Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.

Paul Stanley
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winYeah! Live! Yeah!Win! 

Member 3
Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.

President
My God...they must have no lives at all.

Member 3
A hope?

President
A chance.

Paul Stanley
Llive to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyesLive to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall&lt;p&gt;Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winLive to winLive to winYeah, win 

Kyle
Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.

Cartman
Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!

President
The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.

Member 1
Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?

Member 5
We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!

Member 1
There has to be...someway we can help them.

Member 6
What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?

Member 7
Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!

Thomas
But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.

Member 7
It is not an option!

Thomas
What is this sword?

President
Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.

Member 7
But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.

Thomas
But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.

Member 1
Who foretold this prophecy?

President
Soltzman. He's an accountant.

President
Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.

Cartman
All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!

Stan
I'm in.

Kyle
Me too.

Kenny
(Me too.)

Cartman
Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.

Kyle
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.

Cartman
Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?

Stan
15 agility.

Cartman
Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.

Stan
'K.

Kyle
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?

Cartman
Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?

Liane
Yes hon?

Cartman
More Hot Pockets!

Liane
Right away, hon. 

Stan
That's übercool.

Cartman
All right, everyone ready?

Kyle/Stan
Ready.

Cartman
Let's go get him! 

Stan
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.

Cartman
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.

Kyle
What's the autolocate macro?

Cartman
Command-0. 

Kyle
Okay, right behind Stan.

Cartman
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.

Stan
Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.

Cartman
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.

Kyle
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.

Cartman
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?

Kyle
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.

Cartman
Christ...

Kyle
Cast on him again.

Cartman
Everyone target scorpions.

Randy
Yes?

Member 1
We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.

Randy
That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.

President
Where is he?!

Randy
Who are you?

President
Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!

Member 1
Unless they have this sword,  your son's character is going to die!

Randy
Nn-Oh my God! 

Cartman
Kyle! Fire spell!

Kyle
Aaaa...  AH! Huh?! 

Stan
Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?

Kyle
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! 

Stan
Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! 

Cartman
Wait, we need Ben-Gay. 

Stan
Hurry dude!

Cartman
I'm going as fast as I can!

Stan
Kyle, you have to keep playing.

Kyle
I can't. Just leave me behind.

Stan
We can't do this without you now! Come on! 

Randy
Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!

Sharon
I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.

Member 1
Stupid?

Randy
Where?!

Sharon
I don't know.

Randy
Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!

Sharon
So what?

The three men
So what?! 

President
We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.

Member 1
Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online.

President
I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?

Member 1
No, I have a life. 

Randy
Give me the sword.

Member 1
You?

Randy
I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.

Member 1
We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!

Randy
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 

Randy
Where's your car?

Member 1
We took a cab here!

Randy
Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!

Cartman
All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...

Stan
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!

Cartman
It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!

Liane
What hon?

Cartman
Bathroom! Bathroom! 

Liane
Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? 

Cartman
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.

Randy
World of Warcraft! I need to play!

Greeter
Our demo is set up right over by the- 

Randy
Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! 

Stan
Dude, I'm almost dead.

Cartman
Kyle, cast arcane missile!

Kyle
I'm out of mana, I told you.

Stan
I've gotta heal. 

Randy
Staaan! 

Stan
Dad? Not now!

Randy
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.

Stan
Dad, how did you get that?!

Randy
No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?

Stan
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...

Randy
Okay. 

Cartman
Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 

Stan
I got it! 

Randy
Augh!

Stan
Dad!

Randy
Stan... 

Stan
Dad, no!  You killed my father. 

Cartman
His shield and armor spells are down!

Kyle
Attack! 

Cartman
Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 

Stan
Dad? Dad?

Randy
Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.

Stan
I know you do, Dad.

Randy
Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

Member 1
They did it!

President
Our world is saved! 

Man 1
They did it! They killed him! 

Man 2
They did it!

Woman
They killed him! We can come out!

Cartman
Yes!

Stan
We did it!

Cartman
Yeah!

Stan
Yeah.

Kyle
Yeah yeah.

Cartman
All right, yay.

Kenny
(Woohoo! Oh man!)

Cartman
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.

Kyle
That was such über pwnage

Stan
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?

Cartman
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.

Kyle
Oh yeah.

Cartman
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.

Stan
Got it.

Mrs. Garrison
And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like-  Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.

Mr. Mackey
All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 

Butters
What's a urinal?

Stan
A wall toilet for peeing in.

Mr. Mackey
And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!

Jimmy
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.

Cartman
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.

Kyle
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!

Cartman
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?

Mr. Mackey
Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!

Officer 1
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.

Mr. Mackey
But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.

Officer 1
But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.

Narrator
The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.

Officer 1
So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.

Frank
That sure is a mystery.

Joe
Yeah, it sounds super-hard.

Frank
Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.

Joe
F-really?

Frank
Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now.

Joe
Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.

Frank
My clue is kind of pointing this way.

Joe
Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.

Frank
I've still got a raging clue.

Joe
My clue's pointing over there now!

Frank
Oh, let's follow that clue! 

Stan
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?

Kyle
Not yet.

Cartman
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.

Kyle
Will you shut up about 9/11!

Cartman
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!

Kyle
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!

Cartman
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?

Kyle
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.

Stan
Yeah, at least one-fourth.

Kyle
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.

Cartman
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 

Butters
Hey, fellas!

Cartman
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?

Butters
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.

Cartman
Aha! Do you see?

Kyle
Where did you hear that?

Butters
From Eric.

Cartman
I rest my case.

Kyle
Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?

Butters
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.

Cartman
That's right, Butters.

Kyle
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?

Cartman
What? People see the truth?

Butters
Can I go now?

Cartman
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 

Kyle
Oh no...

Cartman
It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?

Leroy
This is my frog.  He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets. 

Mrs. Garrison
Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?

Cartman
Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!

Mrs. Garrison
All right, Eric, you can go next.

Cartman
For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 

Kyle
Oh Christ...

Cartman
We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?

Clyde
Whoa...

Cartman
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!

Kyle
Me??!

Cartman
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.

Kyle
Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 

Butters
Waaaah! 

Kyle
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!

Sheila
Hello bubbe, how was school today?

Kyle
Terrible.

Sheila
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.

Kyle
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.

Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!

Sheila
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!

Principal Victoria
Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.

Skeeter
Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.

Other men
Oh no, oh brother, oh God.

Mr. Adler
That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?

Other men
Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.

Mr. Mackey
Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!

Sheila
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!

Mr. Mackey
More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!

Jimbo
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!

Mr. Mackey
No, I'm not saying they're related!

Randy
How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 

Skeeter
It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!

Richard
Who else could it have been?

Det. Yates
This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.

Mr. Mackey
Oh no, not the Goddamned-

Narrator
The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.

Det. Yates
So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here,  and they're gone.

Frank
And nobody knows who's responsible?

Det. Yates
There are theories, but, nobody's certain.

Joe
Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?

Frank
Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue.

Joe
Really?

Frank
Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.

Joe
Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.

Frank
Mine's pointing to the left.

Joe
Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.

Frank
Okay, let's follow your raging clue.

Joe
Oofff.

Randy
Godspeed.

Stan
Kyle!

Kyle
Aaaah!

Stan
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??

Kyle
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.

Stan
Well why did you have to involve me??

Kyle
It's not my fault.

Stan
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.

Kyle
Really?

Stan
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?

Kyle
......Dude.

Stan
That's all I needed. 

Mr. Mackey
Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela , the school janitor. Okay?  He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face!  So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!

Mrs. Garrison
Mr. Mackey!  We got him.

Mr. Mackey
Huh?

Mrs. Garrison
We caught the person that did it.

Stan
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.

Man
Aw geez. Come on in, kids.  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.

Kyle
They are?

Kyle
What? No no no.

Stan
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?

Kyle
...That's retarded.

Kyle
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.

Kyle
Code 234

Kyle
What is it?

Kyle
Anthrax?!

Kyle
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!

Mr. Mackey
Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?

Clyde
I don't know. 

Mr. Mackey
You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at!  Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! 

Principal Victoria
Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, that's good!  Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!

Mr. Donovan
Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...

Kyle
Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.

Donald Rumsfeld
Come on in, Mr. President. 

Kyle
Uh, Mr. President, my name is-

Bush
SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything!  We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!

Kyle
Really?

Bush
People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak...  to fix... 

Bush
You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid.

Bush
Too late. 

Stan
JESUS CHRIST!!

Rumsfeld
Hahaha. He died like a pig.

Bush
Some pigs never learn.

Kyle
No. Way.

Stan
He was right. You DID cause 9/11.

Bush
Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.

Kyle
...Really??

Stan
Why?!

Bush
Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags.  Finally we could invade Iraq,  and get the oil which made us all richer than before.

Rumsfeld
Beauutiful money, hahahaha!

Kyle
...Really??

Stan
Is the whole government in on this?

Bush
We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys. 

Cheney
Dangit! I missed again!

Bush
For Christ's sake, Cheney! 

Stan
Kyle! Run! 

Bush
KILL THEM!

Mr. Mackey
Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?!  Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal,  'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see.  Oh yeah, that's real funny!  I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! 

Stan
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.

Kyle
It just... doesn't seem right.

Stan
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.

Kyle
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 

Stan
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 

Kyle
Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here! 

Man 1
Hey!

Man 2
Ogh!

Kyle
Dude! What the hell is going on?!

Stan
What who said?

Kyle
Dude, we aren't going to kill you. 

Stan
Oh God!

Bearded Man
It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!

Kyle
Who the fuck are you?!

Bearded Man
There's no time! come on! 

Kyle
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??

Stan
Who are you?

Bearded Man
I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed.

Kyle
You f-figured this thing all out?

Bearded Man
Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys.  My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue.

Frank
Gave us both a clue.

Mr. Hardly
That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues.

Joe
I was getting a clue like every two minutes.

Frank
I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.

Mr. Hardly
Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.

Frank
It was huuuge.

Mr. Hardly
That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.

Stan
Aw Jesus...

Kyle
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?

Mr. Hardly
For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?

Bush
That's quite enough, Hardly!  Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11.  It's all right here in these secret documents,  but you'll never get them. 

Kyle
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!

Bush
Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing.

Kyle
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!

Bush
We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?

Mr. Hardly
Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here? 

Stan
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!

Kyle
Stan! What the fuck?!

Stan
It was all planned out!

Kyle
You knew this whole time? Why?

Stan
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.

Kyle
What??

Stan
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!

Kyle
So you blamed the government?!

Mr. Hardly
And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!

Stan
Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?

Kyle
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?

Stan
Yuh.

Kyle
So then, who was responsible for 9/11?

Stan
Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.

Frank
Yeah. What are you, retarded? 

Mr. Hardly
Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!

Mr. Mackey
When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!

Cartman
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, Do you smell lemon grass?, and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.

A Hall Monitor
Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office.

Cartman
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!

Hall Monitor
I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.

Cartman
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!

Hall Monitor
I'm just doin' my job.

Cartman
I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!

Principal Victoria
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.

Cartman
Aw Goddamnit!

Principal Victoria
Come on in, Eric. 

Cartman
I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?

Principal Victoria
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 

Cartman
The hall monit- me?

Mr. Mackey
You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? 

Principal Victoria
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.

Cartman
Auth- authoritah?

Mr. Mackey
Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.

Cartman
Ahem. Me?

Cartman
There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!

Car Salesman
Hey, kid, get outta there.

Cartman
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!

Boy
What?

Cartman
You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!

Boy
It's right here. 

Cartman
All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 

Boy
What? You can't just push me up against the-

Cartman
Argh!

Boy
Aah!

Cartman
I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!

Teacher
And so this shape with four sides is what, class?

Cartman
Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!

Teacher
What are you doing?!

Cartman
I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 

Teacher
I don't think that's really necessary.

Cartman
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 

Fillmore
Ike has a crush on teacher!

Class
Ike has a crush on teacher! 

Teacher
That's enough, class!  Okay, well see you tomorrow, everybody. Ike, could you stay just a few minutes, please?  Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age.

Ike
I don't like Mason.

Teacher
You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never...  felt before.   Ike, this is crazy. I'm your teacher. How can we be having these feelings for each other?  You're so mysterious, and I can't... and I can't... 

REO Speedwagon
And I can't fight this feelin' anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashin' through your door
Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore

Teacher
That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand.  We were meant to be, I know it. How else could sex be that incredible? 

Ike
Ike made a nuno.

Butters
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.

Cartman
Hands?! Let me see those hands!

Butters
Haaaah!

Cartman
Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!

Butters
It's, it's... I just had it! 

Cartman
I knew it! 

Cartman
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?

Butters
Huh?

Cartman
Here, you need a smoke, brah?

Butters
Uhh, okay. 

Cartman
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.

Butters
I do. 

Cartman
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 

Sheila
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.

Kyle
Huh?

Sheila
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.

Kyle
What's he doing at his teacher's house?

Sheila
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.

Kyle
Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 

Teacher
OOOH! 

Kyle
Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??

Teacher
Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught.  Hold on, please, you don't understand.

Kyle
Really?! What's there not to understand?!

Teacher
Your brother and I... are in love.

Kyle
He's a little young, don't you think?!

Ike
Oh. 

Teacher
Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!

Ike
Ring around the rosey.

Teacher
He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-

Kyle
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 

Ike
Nonono, nononono.

Kyle
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.

Ike
No, no.

Kyle
Ike?

Teacher
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?

Kyle
This is nuts.

Kyle
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 

Sheila
Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.

Kyle
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.

Sheila
That's great.

Kyle
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.

Ike
Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom.

Sheila
Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?

Kyle
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-

Ike
Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you.

Sheila
Mommy loves you too, sweetie.

Kyle
Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!

Sheila
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 

Det. Yates
You're so full of crap, Foley.

Foley
What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.

Kyle
Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.

Yates
Oh? What's the crime?

Kyle
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.

Yates
Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?

Kyle
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.

Officer 1
A woman.

Kyle
Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. 

Officer 2
Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?

Kyle
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.

Yates
The blonde?

Kyle
Yeah.

Officer 1
Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?

Kyle
Yes.

Officer 1
Nisssse.

Yates
Nnice.

Kyle
What?! No, you don't understand-

Officer 1
You sure they've had sex?

Kyle
Yeah.

Officer 3
Has she performed oral sex on him?

Kyle
I think so.

Officer 3
...Nice.

Officer 1
Nisssse.

Officer 3
Nisssse.

Yates
So wait, what, what's the crime?

Officer 1
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. 

Kyle
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.

Yates
You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his Luckiest Boy In America medal right away. 

Kyles
Gargh!

Kyle
Guys, can I talk to you?

Stan
Sure dude.

Kyle
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-

Cartman
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?

Kyle
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!

Stan
Dude, what's the matter?

Kyle
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.

Stan
...Wow.

Kenny
(Reaaly??)

Cartman
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.

Kyle
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.

Cartman
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.

Kyle
stick it inside her and pee

Cartman
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.

Stan
Dude, I really don't see a problem.

Cartman
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.

Kyle
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 

Cartman
They what??

Kyle
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!

Cartman
Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!

Kyle
Well they're doing it!

Cartman
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!

Miss Stevenson
Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please?  Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you.

Ike
I like dada better.

Miss Stevenson
I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. 

Cartman
Hall infraction! 

Miss Stevenson
Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.

Cartman
You got a hall pass, brah?!

Miss Stevenson
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.

Cartman
Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!

Miss Stevenson
Look, just let us get back in-

Cartman
Get down on the floor!

Miss Stevenson
We're going back inside!

Cartman
You like bear mace, icehead?!

Miss Stevenson
Bear mace??

Cartman
You're goin' with Christ! 

Miss Stevenson
Oooooh!

Cartman
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.

Principal Victoria
Ike, I long to feel your arms around me?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?

Cartman
Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.

Principal Victoria
This is unbelievable.

Cartman
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.

Principal Victoria
Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.

Miss Stevenson
Oh God...

Cartman
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!

Yates
Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. 

Randy
What's goin' on?

Jimbo
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student

Randy
With a student? But... she's a woman.

Jimbo
Yeah. I know.

Randy
But... she's hot.

Kyle
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.

Cartman
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 

Kyle
Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.

Ike
You are dead to me!

Kyle
What?

Ike
I said, you're dead to me!

Kyle
I'm dead to you?

Ike
You're dead to me, Kyle!

Miss Stevenson
I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared.  Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this.

Reporter
Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom.

Miss Stevenson
I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.

Man 1
Nice.

Man 2
Nissse

Miss Stevenson
I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.

Officer 4
Ohhhh.

Miss Stevenson
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.

Cartman
Oh no!

Kyle
What?

Cartman
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.

Miss Stevenson
I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.

Yates
Well, that explains it.

Officer 1
Do we still press charges?

Yates
Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?

Man 3
Poor woman. She's a victim.

Randy
Yeah, she's a hot victim. 

Lawyer
My client has agreed to check herself into rehab immediately. 

Print Reporter
Good luck, ma'am. You can beat your alcoholism. 

Therapist
Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family?

Miss Stevenson
No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to loss and he'd take pictures.

Therapist
Nissse.  Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.

Miss Stevenson
All better now. 

Miss Stevenson
Ike. 

Ike
Miss Stephenson 

Miss Stevenson
Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about. 

Ike
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan!

Miss Stevenson
Get your things together. We don't have much time.

Kyle
Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 

Yates
Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?

Foley
No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'!

Sheila
Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!

Yates
You're kidding!

Sheila
No, it's true!

Yates
Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!

Sheila
This is serious!

Officer 3
Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful older woman. Quick! Call the FBI! 

Sheila
Are you going to do nothing?!

Yates
All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...

Cartman
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!

Kyle
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.

Cartman
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.

Kyle
How do you know that?

Cartman
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.

Kyle
Who's Beth?

Cartman
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!

Cartman
I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?

Butters
Ehthat was pretty good.

Kyle
Can we get going now, please?!

Cartman
Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 

Miss Stevenson
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?

Ike
I love TV. Yaaay!

Miss Stevenson
But what about me? I want to talk. 

Cartman
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!

Leeroy
She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?

Cartman
Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 

Bellboy
Hey! You can't leave your car there!

Cartman
It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!

Receptionist
Can I help you?

Cartman
You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!

Receptionist
Who are you?

Cartman
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!

Head Concierge
I think you should leave before I call the police!

Cartman
Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!

Bellboy
We need police here, right away! 

Guest 1
Yes?

Cartman
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!

Guest 2
Do you mind keepin' it down?

Cartman
Keep your mouth shut, brah!!

Miss Stevenson
Oh no! Ike!  They're on to us!

Ike
Oh no!

Miss Stevenson
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!

Officers
What have we got? What have we got?!

Officer 5
Who called 911?!

Receptionist
They went that way.  Look out! They have bear mace!

Leeroy
Open up! I'm with the Dawg! 

Kyle
Oh crap! 

Officer 6
You freeze right there! 

Miss Stevenson
Come on, darling! 

Earl
Hey!  Uh I got 'em, Dawg. 10-4!

Cartman
Praise Christ! Let's go! 

Miss Stevenson
Ike, run! 

Cartman
Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 

Cartman
Freeze, bitch!

Officer 7
Freeze!

Officer 8
Hands up! Hands up!

Officer 9
Don't move! Don't move!

Cartman
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.

Officer 10
Hey, that is the teacher we just got the report about. 

Officer 7
All right, Miss Stevenson, you got nowhere to go!

Miss Stevenson
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.

Cartman
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!

Leeroy
She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?

Miss Stevenson
It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan. 

Officer 7
Now hold on, don't do anything foolish! We can talk about this!

Miss Stevenson
You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.

Kyle
No! Ike, don't do it!

Ike
I don deser futty bad man.

Kyle
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 

Miss Stevenson
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.

Kyle
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 

Miss Stevenson
I'm afraid you're too late.  Are you ready, my love?  Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh!  Ike?? 

Ike
Yaaaay!

Kyle
Ike!

Cartman
Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.

Officer 8
Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.

Cartman
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 

Satan
Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine.

Demon 1
What do you plan, Lord Satan?

Satan
On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!

Demon 2
How big a party are we talking?

Satan
Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big.

Demon 2
Satan, we can't possibly do-

Satan
SILENCE!  Halloween is about me! And I deserve a par-ty! This... shall be MY Super Sweet 16!!  Minions of Hell! The time has come for us to rise! For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!!  I got Bacardi, and Ghetto One to sponsor the party, and I'm calling it  Hell On Earth 2006!  But now, heed my words: in order to get in to the party, you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband. Everyone is gonna try and get into this party, so if you don't get your wristband in advance, or you're not wearing that wristband at the door, you're NOT GETTING IN!!  And NOW know this: It's a costume party, so you have to wear a costume. BUT... nobody better show up as The Crow! I'm serious. Every costume party there's like fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow 'cause they wanna look hot and hook up. It's lame! If you come dressed as the Crow, you're NOT GETTING IN to the party!!  Go now and prepare!! If you miss my party you are a looozer!! 

George Burns
Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.

Ghandi
I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.

Princess Diana
This is going to be the best Halloween ever. 

Stan
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.

Kyle
I am doing it.

Tweek
No! Don't do it!

Cartman
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.

Kyle
Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...

Cartman
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 

Kyle
Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!

Cartman
I've done it lots of times.

Kyle
Prove it!

Cartman
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.

Kyle
You're afraid to do it, too.

Cartman
I am not!

Butters
Then do it, if you're not yellow! 

Cartman
Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 

Jimmy
Hey fellas.  You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.

The other boys
Let's go. Yeah, let's go!

Cartman
Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!

Demon 1
Satan, I must speak with thee.

Satan
What is it?

Demon 1
You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.

Satan
Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.

Demon 1
Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends.

Satan
I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first!

Demon 1
I hope for your sake that's true. You've never thrown a party of this magnitude before, Satan. Be wary. 

Cardinal Mahoney
Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook.  There's more: None of us... are invited. 

Bishop 1
None?

Bishop 2
Satan mocks us.

Bishop 3
His party must be stopped.

Priest 1
Yes, we cannot let evil take over our city, even for a night. 

Priest 2
What can we do? 

Resident Bishop
Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up.

Butters
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  

Biggie Smalls
What the fuck is THIS?!

Butters
AAAAH! 

Biggie Smalls
Hey! 

Butters
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Stephen
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!

Butters
I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!

Stephen
You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!

Butters
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!

Stephen
Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!

Butters
AAAAAAAAAAH! 

Stephen
...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?

Satan
So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here.

Male Staffer
What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell?

Satan
Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars.

Female Staffer
Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate.

Satan
I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.

Demon 1
This is getting really expensive.

Satan
Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain.

Male Staffer
Oh yeah, P Diddy had his birthday party here a couple years back and he had one of those.

Satan
Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one.

Demon 1
Does it matter?!

Satan
Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!

Demon 1
How about a doughnut machine?

Satan
Did Diddy do it?

Male Staffer
Diddy did do it.

Satan
A full ice cream bar!

Male Staffer
Diddy did it.

Satan
Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?!  Wait. I know.  Yes. It's perfect. At midnight, all the lights go down. The music stops. And then we wheel in... a Ferrari. Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake. And everyone gets a piece.

Demon 1
A Ferrari cake?

Male Staffer
Diddy didn't do it.

Demon 1
Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-

Satan
This party has to be the bomb! Don't you get it?!  When everyone sees the Ferrari cake,  they will shudder and know my greatness!

Demon 3
Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy!  Jeffrey Dahmer!  And John Wayne Gacy!  You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel!

Bundy
No problem.

Dahmer
We can handle it.

Demon 3
Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!

Smalls
You punkass fool!

Butters
Haaaah.

Smalls
Why'd you summon me?

Butters
P-please don't ice me, homie?

Smalls
You'd better have a good reason, sucka!

Butters
I just... w-was seein' if it works.

Smalls
Damn! Every Halloween I gots tuh deal with this shit! I'm in hell, mindin' my own business, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kid's bafroom.

Butters
I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.

Smalls
You don't understand, fool! I ain't missin' the party!

Butters
W-what party?

Smalls
I already got my wristband, see?  You've got to get me to Los Angeles!

Butters
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?

Smalls
How, punk?! We don't use money in her, nigga!

Butters
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!

Smalls
This is your fault, homie! You've gots to get me to that party in L.A., or i'm gonna smoke your ass!

Butters
Oh hamburgers!

Demon 1
Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.

Satan
Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter.

Zazul
Ehhhhhhh.

Satan
Zazul, switch costumes with me.

Demon 1
Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.

Satan
Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul.  And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!

Demon 1
Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.

Bundy
All right, this is the place. Now remember, you numbskulls, this Ferrari cake is really important for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!

Dahmer
Who's lousing?

Bundy
Come 'ere.  Shut up! 

Head Baker
Can I help you?

Bundy
We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.

Head Baker
Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to?

Bundy
We got that flatbed. 

Head Baker
Okay well, we're just gonna need to- GYAAAH! 

Bundy
Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!

Gacy
I didn't mean tuh. 

Bundy
Give me that! 

Gacy
Oh!

Bundy
What's the matter with you?!  Take this!

Baker 2
Everything all right?  Bwa! Gaaaghaghaghagh!

Bundy
You nincompoop! 

Dahmer
Ow.

Bundy
That was the baker!

Dahmer
He startled me.

Bundy
Gacy!  What'dja kill him for?!  Siddonw!

Gacy
I'm a victim of circumstance. 

Bundy
Ahh, who're you hittin'? 

Dahmer
Ohhhh... 

Gacy
Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk.  Oh!

Bundy
Get outta here.  Be quiet.  You idiots! Now who's gonna help us load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!

Officer
Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?

Linda
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 

Cartman
Dude...

Jimmy
Du... du... dude.

Stan
Dad! Dad!

Randy
What?

Stan
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??

Randy
Biggie Smalls?

Cartman
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues

Randy
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.

Cartman
How do you know??

Randy
I'm a geologist! 

Kyle
He's right. It's just a spook story.

Tweek
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?

Kyle
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.

Cartman
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?

Butters
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-

Smalls
Yo dawg, keep it down.

Butters
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?

Smalls
Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right.  Hey! 

Kyle
...Smalls. 

Smalls
Oh, God-damnit! 

Stan
It does work!!

Kyle
Holy crap!!

Smalls
That's it! Now I'm pissed! 

George Burns
Hehey, everybody. Check out Hitler.  He's the Can you hear me now? guy. 

Hitler
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? 

Satan
Everyone quiet! Here he is, the man of the night, SATAN!  Get out of the way, Hitler! You're ruining my entrance! Gaau!

Cardinal Mahoney
Yes, hello? It this the fire department?  Wait, shh, shh, shh.  I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal.  He's what? Where?  Damn your evil heart, Satan!!

Resident Bishop
What?

Cardinal Mahoney
The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him!
Priest:
 Satan's trickery knows no bounds! 
Cardinal Mahoney:
 That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party! 

Satan
This is VIP. Don't just let anybody into my VIP area, okay? 

Frank Sinatra
Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.

Satan
What?

Frank Sinatra
Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests.

Satan
Oh jeez.  Hey, uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know, the whole Crocodile Hunter thing? It... it's just a little soon, you know? I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago and... it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.

Steve Irwin
But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin. I am the Crocodile Hunter.

Satan
Oh... oh, but then, dude, no costume. Sorry, you gotta go. 

Steve Irwin
Wait! I thought we were friends!

Satan
Oh hey, Sinatra! 

Male Staffer
Demonius!  Demonius, we have a problem!

Demonius
What is it?

Male Staffer
The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!

Demonius
What?? Don't even tell me that!

Male Staffer
It was never delivered to the hotel.

Demonius
Deva! Fetch my Blackberry! That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight! 

Man
Do you gentlemen need a hand? 

Bundy
Gacy!  Whatcha do that foor?!

Gacy
I did it for Dahmer.

Bundy
For Dahmer?

Gacy
Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies. 

Bundy
Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!

Dahmer
What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?

Bundy
We gotta get rid of this body before anyone sees it!  Now get those to the trashcan!  Stop eating that! 

Gacy
Leave him alone!  Unh!

Bundy
Cut it!  Come 'ere, ya. 

Dahmer, Gacy
Oh! 

Dahmer
There.  Oh.  The cake! 

Bundy
Oh no!

Gacy
Mmm, Ferrari.

Bundy
What's the matter with you?! It's ruined!

Dahmer
We're gonna get it now.

A guest
This is a really extravagant party, Satan.

Satan
I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert! 

Black Bouncer
Uh, these aren't the right wristbands.

A Bishop
Uh, yes they are.

White Bouncer
Then how come they say Knott's Berry Farm? 

Cardinal Mahoney
In the name of Christ, just let us in!

Stan
We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.

Smalls
Not as sorry as you're gonna be, if I completely miss the party!

Ticket agent
Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes.

Kyle
See? You can still make it for the end of the party.

Smalls
Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss-  What the? No! No!

Randy
...Smalls.  No way!

Smalls
Motherfucking God-damnit!

Randy
That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!

Smalls
Cool this, sucka! 

Bundy
All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake.

Dahmer
No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school.

Bundy
Yeah? Why'd you quit?

Dahmer
There weren't enough Italians to eat. 

Gacy
Nyak nyak nyak nyak nya-eh  Nyaaa nyaaaa

Bundy
Get over here!  All right, what's the recipe call for first?

Dahmer
Ten thousand eggs.

Bundy
Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.

Gacy
You get 'em!

Bundy
Shut up!

Gacy
Nyaaaaa! 

Bundy
Oh! Ohh, wise guy, ey? 

Gacy
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Bundy
How's that?

Dahmer
Hey! Leave him alone! 

Bundy
AAA!

Dahmer
Nehhh!

Bundy
Try that again!

Dahmer
Nehhh! 

Gacy
What happened??

Bundy
Shut up! 

Cowboy
He can't do it, he can't do it.

John Elway
All right, be quiet.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Oh I can't do it! I'm too freaked out. 

Male Staffer
What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived!

Zazul
This is terrible!

Demonius
It's okay! It's okay!  I found a backup! Go ahead and start the ceremony! 

Zazul
Your attention please: It is now midnight! Time for Satan's special surprise. 

A Guest
I wonder what this is going to be.

Satan
Just you wait.  Yes. Here it comes. 

Zazul
Ladies and gentlemen: a fully edible Acura cake! 

Satan
Acura?? But I wanted a Ferrari! 

Demonius
We did the best we could; there was a problem.

Zazul
Acuras are really nice.

Satan
IT'S NOT THE CAR I WANTED! THE WHOLE PARTY'S RUINED! 

Demonius
It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care.

Satan
IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEE!!! 

Frank Sinatra
Wow, what a jerk.

A Cowboy
Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.

Satan
Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them.

Zazul
Satan, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not as bad as they are.

Satan
But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl.  Open the doors! Let everyone in, wristband or no! 

Butters
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 

Smalls
What the-?

Butters
Thanks. 

Smalls
I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.

Butters
Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.

Smalls
And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?

Butters
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 

Cartman
Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 

Liane
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?

Cartman
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.

Liane
When does it come out?

Cartman
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!

Liane
It's time for school

Cartman
No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.

Liane
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 

Cartman
Noo!! Nooo!!

Mrs. Garrison
Principal Victoria, it is wrong!  It is wrong and I simply will not do it!  I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies!  I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! 

Principal Victoria
Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.

Mrs. Garrison
Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!

Mr. Mackey
M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.

Mrs. Garrison
I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!

Principal Victoria
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.

Cartman
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!

Stan
It's still three weeks.

Cartman
Oh God...  Okay, how long now?

Kyle
Will you shut up already?! 

Mrs. Garrison
All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.

Butters
Oh boy!

Mrs. Garrison
Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this:  In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its  mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this.  retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you!  So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!

Cartman
HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!

Mrs. Garrison
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.

Cartman
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 

Clerk
Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. 

Liane
Eric, you're coming home right now!

Cartman
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?

Liane
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.

Cartman
Oh God!

Cartman
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!

Cartman
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.

Stan
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.

Cartman
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.

Kyle
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.

Cartman
No. There is something I can do.

Kenny
(What?)

Cartman
All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.

Stan
Do what?

Cartman
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.

Kyle
No.

Cartman
It's simple science, Kyle.

Kyle
You'll die, retard!

Cartman
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!

Stan
Dude, no way.

Kyle
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.

Cartman
I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 

Father
Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!

Mrs. Garrsion
I told you this would happen, didn't I?!

Principal Victoria
Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-

Mr. Triscotti
We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!

Mrs. Garrsion
I hear ya.

Principal Victoria
Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.

Mr. Triscotti
You most certainly will!

Daughter
But Dad, I want to learn everything.

Mr. Triscotti
No you don't! Shut up! 

Mrs. Garrsion
Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms.

Principal Victoria
It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 

Mrs. Garrsion
Re-replaced??

Principal Victoria
Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.

Mr. Dawkins
Charmed to meet you. Ms...

Mrs. Garrsion
Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!

Principal Victoria
You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!

Mr. Dawkins
Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. 

Mrs. Garrison
Whatever.

Mr. Dawkins
It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.

Mrs. Garrison
Retarded fish-frogs.

Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.

Mrs. Garrison
Well, you're a faggot!  Continue.

Mr. Dawkins
You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.

Mrs. Garrison
So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.

Mr. Dawkins
Well yes, basically, we are.

Mrs. Garrison
Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!

Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!

Mrs. Garrison
What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?

Mr. Dawkins
Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.

Mrs. Garrison
AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!

Mr. Dawkins
I never covered it up.

Mrs. Garrison
And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?! 

Mr. Dawkins
What on earth are you doing?? 

Mrs. Garrison
Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!! 

Mr. Dawkins
AAAH!

Mrs. Garrison
Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.

Principal Victoria
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.

Mrs. Garrison
What??

Mr. Dawkins
Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.

Principal Victoria
Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??

Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?

Mrs. Garrison
What?!

Mr. Dawkins
Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.

Mrs. Garrison
You d-you do?

Mr. Dawkins
I've never met a woman with so much... fire

Mrs. Garrison
Well I...  I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again. 

Mr. Dawkins
So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-

Mrs. Garrison
No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.

Mr. Dawkins
Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?

Mrs. Garrison
Well,  well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something. 

Mrs. Garrison
I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  Oh boy, what'll I wear?!  Hey everybody!

Cartman
Ey!

Liane
Whoa!

Cartman
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!

Liane
Eric, get out of there. 

Cartman
No! No, it's too soon!

Liane
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!

Cartman
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.

Butters
Go where?

Cartman
You're gonna help me freeze myself.

Butters
Okay. 

Butters
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?

Cartman
Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!

Butters
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?

Cartman
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea

Butters
Yeah...I guess it is...

Cartman
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?

Butters
I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.

Cartman
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!

Butters
Oh jeez! 

Cartman
Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.

Mrs. Garrison
So I told my gynecologist, you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you! 

Mr. Dawkins
Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.

Mrs. Garrison
Hehyeah, almost.

Mr. Dawkins
You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.

Mrs. Garrison
Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.

Mr. Dawkins
Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?

Mrs. Garrison
Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.

Mr. Dawkins
Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?

Mrs. Garrison
You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened!  Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!

Mr. Dawkins
Really?? Oh that's wonderful!

Mrs. Garrison
No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!

Mr. Dawkins
You're so welcome!

Mrs. Garrison
Would you like tuh...  head over to my place for dessert?

Mrs. Garrison
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!

Mr. Dawkins
Oh Ms. Garrison!

Mrs. Garrison
Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!

Cartman
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.

Medic
We have a pulse. 

Alien 1
Can you... understand me?

Cartman
Where am I?

Shvek
My name is Shvek. You are safe.

Cartman
Safe where, butthole?!

Shvek
My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.

Cartman
What??

Shvek
You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! 

Medic
Please be careful. You are frail.

Cartman
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?

Analyst
Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.

Cartman
Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!

Medic
Young man, you don't seem to understand.  Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.

Cartman
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!

Shvek
We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.

Cartman
No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

Mr. Dawkins
You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.

Mrs. Garrison
That's my man.

Mr. Dawkins
So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.

Mrs. Garrison
That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.

Mr. Dawkins
Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-

Stan
Well there could still be a god.

Mrs. Garrison
What?!

Stan
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?

Mrs. Garrison
Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class!  Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!

Stan
I wasn't talking about spaghetti. 

Mrs. Garrison
Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! 

Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.

Mrs. Garrison
What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.

Mr. Dawkins
Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.

Mrs. Garrison
You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world.

Mr. Dawkins
Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.

Mrs. Garrison
You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.

Mr. Dawkins
Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.

Mrs. Garrison
Oh, all right. 

Mr. Dawkins
Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. 

Mrs. Garrison
OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! 

Butters
Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!

Dougie
Pehpew Pehpew! 

Butters
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!

Linda
Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?

Butters
Who, me?

Linda
It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?

Butters
No ma'am.

Linda
Okay. 

Dougie
Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 

Butters
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?

Dougie
Okay.

Butters
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?

Dougie
...Yeah.

Butters
Well, like what?

Dougie
...Like, you die.

Butters
...Die??

Dougie
Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.

Butters
Oh hamburgers!! 

Butters
Eric! Erihic!

Dougie
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!

Butters
He told me to!

Dougie
He's dead for sure.

Butters
Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!

Dougie
Oh my God...

Butters
Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!

Dougie
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!

Butters
What??

Dougie
Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! 

Butters
But I just did what he told me!

Dougie
Come on, we have to leave!!

Butters
Oh jumping Jesus! 

Cartman
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 

Shvek
Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.

Cartman
What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!

Medic
It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.

Cartman
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!

Shvek
Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.

Shvek
You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.

Medic
Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.

Cartman
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.

Shvek
You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.

Cartman
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?

Medic
We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.

Cartman
Who? 

Shvek
What in Science's name was that?! 

Medic
Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!

Shvek
Oh Science, help us! 

UAA Member 1
Science damn you, Unified Atheist League!

Cartman
Who are they??

Shvek
The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. 

UAL Member 1
No! 

Cartman
Jesus Christ!

Shvek
Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  Oh my Science. 

Cartman
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.

UAA Member 1
Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance!

UAA Member 2
Onscreen.

UAA Member 1
Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child!

AAA Leader
Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!

UAA Member 1
Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!

AAA Leader
It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!

Cartman
What??

AAA Leader
Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!

Sea Otters
The nafferty! 

AAA Leader
So, it begins!

Narrator
The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years.

Otter Leader
Whoa, steady!  This way, otters! 

Otter 1
This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child. 

Cartman
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.

Otter 1
Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.

Cartman
We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 

Otter Leader
Something is spooking the ostriches.

Cartman
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.

Otter Leader
Here it is! We have arrived.

Blavius
Hold!  This is it, Time Child.  The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here.

Cartman
Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 

Blavius
All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.

Cartman
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 

Blavius
NOOOO!

Otter Leader
It was a trick!

Blavius
SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!

Cartman
I got it! I got the Wii!

UAA Leader
Time Child! You've returned!

UAA 1
We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.

Cartman
Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 

UAA Leader
TC, wait!

Cartman
Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!

UAA Leader
You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!

Cartman
Here. 

UAA 1
Science be praised. This could end the war!

UAA Leader
You've done a great thing, TC.  How can we repay you?

Cartman
Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 

Cartman
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!

Maintenance Guy
Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your flaot screen.

Cartman
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!

Maintenance Guy
It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.

Cartman
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 

UAA Woman
TC? What's wrong?

Cartman
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!

UAA Woman
Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10. 

K-10
Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.

Cartman
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.

UAA Leader
Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!

UAA 2
But, those are civilian otters.

UAA Leader
We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.

UAA 3
Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!

UAA Leader
...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.

UAL 1
The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Allieance's clam fields.

UAL 2
Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death.

UAL 3
Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all.

Shvek
No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago.  Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future.  But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!

Announcer
With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before.

Woman
My monvert's never looked so clean. 

Cartman
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 

Boy 1
Agh! I'm so bored.

Boy 2
There's nothing to do.

Cartman
Tell me about it.

Boy 3
Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past!

Boy 1
Huh?

Boy 3
I just got...  the Crank Prank Time Phone! 

Singers
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.

Announcer
New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone!

Boy Announcer
I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and...

Boy 1
Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  Hello? Is there a refrigierator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! 

Singers
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.

Cartman
What?

Boy 2
Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? 

Announcer
Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator , antimatter fusion cone, andn 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Makng anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters.

Cartman
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!

K-10
Why does it matter? Bark bark

Cartman
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.

K-10
Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.

Cartman
I care! Where's the closest toy store??

K-10
Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping comples. But it is not open yet.

Cartman
Come on! Come on!

Voice
Store is now... open.  Welcome

Cartman
Ugh, finally!

Clerk
Welcome to Zeebod's Toys

Cartman
I want one of those time-phone things.

Clerk
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?

Cartman
Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.

Clerk
All right, that'll be 6000 credits. 

Cartman
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!

Clerk
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.

Cartman
Look, I have to have one of those phones!

Clerk
Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. 

K-10
Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.

Cartman
How about a robot? How much for the robot?

K-10
Awww.

Clerk
Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.

Cartman
Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?

K-10
Working, bark bark. Access.

Cartman
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.

K-10
Working, bark bark.

Blavius
The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!

Otters
Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!

Blavius
And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!

Man
I'll get it, darling.  Hello? Hello?

Boy 4
Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?

Man
I;m sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.

Boy 4
Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?

Man
Nno, there are no Walls here.

Boy 4
Then how does your roof stay up? 

Man
Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!

Boy 4
No, we're from the future. 

Man
Very funny!

Boy 5
Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too?

Man
God darn ya! 

Boy 4
Yeah.

Boy 5
That was a great one! 

Cartman
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.

Boy 4
Oh. Okay, I guess.

Cartman
Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 

Boy 5
Hey!

Cartman
Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 

Boy 4
Science H. Logic! What a jerk!

The Wise One
Silence, otters!

Otter 1
It's the Wise One

Otter 2
The Wise One speaks.

The Wise One
This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?

Blavius
Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science.

The Wise One
Science, reason, is that really all there is?

Blavius
They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!

Otter Leader
Yes!  The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy?

The Wise One
Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist.

Otter Soldier
Kill the Wise One!

Otter 3
Kill the Wise One! 

The Wise One
Whoa, wait wait! 

Cartman
Oh God!  Hello? 

Time Child
Hello?  Are you there?

Cartman
Who is this?

Time Child
No, no, I have me.  All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!

Cartman
What?? Who the hell is this?!

Time Child
It's me.

Cartman
Me who?!

Time Child
Me you!

Cartman
What?!

Time Child
I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!

Cartman
Oh very funny, Kyle!

Time Child
It's not Kyle, it's you!

Cartman
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.

Time Child
I'm trying to do you a favor, dumbass!! Just listen to me!

Cartman
Listen to this!  Dickhead. 

Time Child
What an asshole!

Butters
Hello? 

Time Child
Butters? Butters!

Butters
Eric? Iiis that you?

Time Child
Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!

Butters
Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?

Time Child
No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!

Butters
But...  but you're here right now. 

Cartman
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!

Time Child
No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!

Butters
Huh??

Cartman
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!

Butters
But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.

Cartman
What??  Who the fuck is this?!

Time Child
Aw damnit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!

Cartman
Suck my balls!

Time Child
No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!

Cartman
...Okay, you have one minute.

Time Child
Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?

Cartman
Are you spying on me?!

Time Child
No, I am you, you stupid asshole!

Cartman
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!

Butters
Oh, all right then.

Time Child
God I hate that guy!!

UAA Leader
My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields! 

UAL Aide
Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.

UAL Leader
Then begin the attack! Science be praised.

Otter Leader
Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science! 

Kyle
Hello? 

Time Child
Hello? Kyle?

Kyle
Hello?

Time Child
Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?

Kyle
What do you want?!

Time Child
Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?

Kyle
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!

Time Child
No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.

Kyle
... Uh huh.

Time Child
No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog. 

K-10
Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.

Kyle
... I'm hanging up now.

Time Child
No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.

Kyle
Suck my balls, fatass.

Time Child
... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. 

Kyle
Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 

Time Child
Kyle?  Kyle!

KIT-9
Eric, I really think you should stop calling the past. You could change the present.

Time Child
Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?

KIT-9
I guess not, meow meow.

Time Child
Hm, I see...  Hey!

KIT-9
Meow meow. 

Time Child
Heeeeey!

KIT-9
Meow meow.

UAA Woman
TC! We're under attack!

Time Child
By who?!

UAA Woman
We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place!

UAA Leader
The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!

Cartman
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!

Tactical Officer
Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal!

UAA Leader
What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen! 

Shvek
What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!

Blavius
Yes. And we're attacking both of you!

UAA Leader
You fools! This will be the end of us all!

Blavius
Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw.

UAA Leader
Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!

Cartman
What is the Great Question?

KIT-9
What atheists should call themselves.

Shvek
Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.

UAA Leader
&gt;Unified Atheist Allianace makes more sense.

Blavius
No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!

Shvek
So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.

Tactical Officer
Forward missiles launched, sir!

Cartman
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!

KIT-9
But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.

Cartman
Who?

KIT-9
Your teacher, the one called Garrison.

Cartman
Garrison? But he's an asshole.

Mrs. Garrison
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!

Mr. Dawkins
Oh Ms. Garrison!

Mrs. Garrison
Damnit, who the hell is calling?!

Mr. Dawkins
I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?

Cartman
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!

Mr. Dawkins
An emergency?

Cartman
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!

Mr. Dawkins
I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.

Cartman
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!

Mr. Dawkins
Sex-change operation??

Mrs. Garrison
Uh oh.

Mr. Dawkins
Uuuuugh! You're a man?!

Mrs. Garrison
Not anymore. I've been fixed.  Richard, hold on. I can explain.

Mr. Dawkins
Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? 

Mrs. Garrison
Richard, come back, please!  Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!

Cartman
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 

Shvek
All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?

Cartman
Go... Right... Where am I going? 

UAA Leader
W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.

Blavius
Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen.

Cartman
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?

Shvek
Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.

Medic
Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.

Cartman
So there is no war now in the future.

Blavius
Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.

All
Yeah!

UAA Leader
But now the moment has come to send you back to your time. 

Shvek
We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.

Cartman
And what was that purpose again?

Shvek
We explained that to you already.

Cartman
Right... 

COCKA-3
Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk

Cartman
I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.

UAA Leader
So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. 

Cartman
Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!

Liane
There you are, Eric.

Cartman
Mom! Mom, they did it!

Liane
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.

Cartman
No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.

Liane
But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.

Cartman
What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!

Liane
Who are you talking to, muffin?

Cartman
I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!

Clerk
Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.

Cartman
Hello?

Time Child
Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!

Cartman
...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 

Editor
Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.

Stan
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.

Mr. Jarvis
Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it!  You aren't delivering the papers on time!

Stan
My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 

Mr. Jarvis
Is that your bike out there? 

Stan
Yeah. Why?

Mr. Jarvis
'Cause it's being towed.

Stan
What?? 

Stan
Hey, hey! What are you doing?!

Driver
This your bike?

Stan
Yes!

Driver
It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. 

Stan
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!

Driver
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 

Stan
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 

Judge
Yes? Come in.

Stan
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-

Judge
Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.

Stan
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?

Judge
Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is,  his bike's been impounded!  But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy. 

Stan
Look, I really need my bike.

Judge
Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything..

Stan
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!

Judge
Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.

Stan
...Yeah?

Judge
Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.

Stan
Me?

Judge
Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach...  a pee wee hockey team!  And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow.

Stan
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.

Stan
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-

Stan
All right, fine, go ahead.

Stan
S- hold it a while, okay?

Stan
When you shoot the puck to another player.

Stan
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.

Stan
Why not?!

Stan
What, you got asthma or something?

Stan
What?

Stan
Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.

Stan
Oh Jesus, can we just practice?

Stan
NO! 

Coach
Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers! 

Coach
We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow.  Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team.

Stan
Hey. 

Gavin
Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?

Park County
Yeah!!

Gavin
Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!

Adams County
Right! Follow! 

Stan
Jesus Christ. 

Sharon
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!

Randy
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!

Stan
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.

Randy
Oh, well that's good.

Sharon
What kind of job?

Stan
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.

Randy
...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.

Stan
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.

Randy
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?

Stan
What are you talking about?

Randy
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?

Stan
I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.

Randy
Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!

Stan
I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. 

Randy
What are we goin' to do, Sharon??

Sharon
What?

Randy
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.

Sharon
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.

Randy
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.

Announcer
And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.  And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck. 

Denver Goalie
I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em! 

Announcer
Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants.  Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!

Crowd
Ohhhh!

Randy
Stan?? Shoot it! 

Announcer
Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!

Kyle
You got it, Stan!

Randy
Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!

Announcer
Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing. 

Sharon
Randy, what's wrong??

Randy
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.

Stan
All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.

A Man
Coach? Hey coach.  Could we talk to you, please? 

Woman
We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?

Stan
Oh

Mr. Brown
Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad. 

Stan
Ohhh.

Mr. Brown
Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?  You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!

Mrs. Brown
Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach.

Mr. Brown
No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just...  I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?

Stan
... I don't know.

Mr. Brown
Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you.

Stan
No, I think you oughta.

Mr. Brown
Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.

Mrs. Brown
Please, coach, he's...  he's counting on you!

Mr. Brown
Please, coach, he's counting on you!

Stan
Oh uh, hey Nelson.

Nelson
Oh.  Hi, coach.

Stan
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?

Nelson
Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?

Stan
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?

Nelson
How come I have to die now?

Stan
Ogh.

Nelson
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?

Stan
Goddammit, dude, I don't know.

Nelson
I'm sorry.

Stan
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?

Nelson
I think so.

Stan
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 

Nelson
Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?

Stan
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.

Nelson
Well then, will you just... win for me?

Stan
Okay. 

Judge
Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... Bummin' on Cancer. 

Announcer
Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County. 

Adams County
Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!

Stan
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

Gavin
Come to surrender, coach?

Stan
Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?

Gavin
HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no!  Win! Win! Win! Win!

Adams County
Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...

Stan
All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 

Stan
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.

Gavin
Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!  Yeah! Let's go Adams!

Stan
Let's go, Park! Come on!

Gavin
That's it, Brian! Kill him! 

Stan
Get near the puck! 

Announcer
And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.

Stan
Tie? Well, what does that mean?

Judge
Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is,  he tied!  And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning. 

Stan
Hello?

Nelson
Coach.

Stan
How are you feeling?

Nelson
I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?

Dr. Doctor
Oh, hello Coach.

Stan
Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?

Dr. Doctor
Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.

Stan
Oh boy.

Nelson
Oh. My cancer hurts.

Dr. Doctor
He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.

Stan
But what can I do?

Judge
Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!

Nelson
Wow.  At the Pepsi Center?

Dr. Doctor
Look! He's coming around again.

Nelson
That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?

Stan
Well, ah, I mean...

Judge
Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... Stanley's Cup! Rated R. 

Stan
Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.

Nelson
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.

Dr. Doctor
Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.

Stan
Well, sure we can.

Stan
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?

Stan
They're not gonna kill us.

Stan
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.

Stan
Hey that's right. We need a ringer. 

Park County
Yeah!

Kyle
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.

Stan
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 

Park County
Yeah!

Kyle
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.

Randy
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.

Stan
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.

Randy
Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying That's my son!  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 

Announcer
His shot is blocked! What a great save!  And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all.  And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.

Stan
All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!

Official
Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.

Stan
Huh?

Official
The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.

Park County
We came to play.

Stan
Sso then we win?

Official
No. Nobody wins.

Stan
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!

Official
Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do.

Stan
But it isn't supposed to end like this!

Av 1
Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they have to play.

Av 2
Yeah.

Official
Well, who are they gonna play?

Av 1
They can take our place.

Av 3
Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.

Stan
Play the Red Wings?

Judge
Stan Marsh coaches a Pee Wee hockey team. But now  they're going to play in the big leagues.  They've got small bodies but big hearts. Stan Marsh is... going professional. 

Av 1
All right! Give 'em hell, boys!

The Avs
All right! Yeah!

Announcer
It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.

Denver Fans
OHHHHHHHHH!

Stan
Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!

Man
Let them play!

Fans
Let them play! Let them play! 

Stan
Hey, can they do that??

Ike
Ow, no. Oh! 

A Red Wing
Yeah! We did it! We did it! 

Randy
NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! 

Red Wings Coach
Thank you, Dad.

Former Coach
I'm proud of you, boy. 

Fans
Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!

Nelson
No hope. No... hope... 

Fans
Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!

Announcer
And now back to Wheel of Fortune!

Pat Sajak
All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!

Randy
Thanks, Pat!

Pat Sajak
You've got some family here watching tonight. 

Randy
Yeah, they're all rooting for me.

Pat Sajak
And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?

Randy
Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!

Jimbo
That's us!

Stephen
Hehey! 

Man 1
Hey Randy!

Jimbo
Good luck!

Pat Sajak
Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is  People Who Annoy You.

Randy
Okay. 

Pat Sajak
As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.

Randy
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.

Pat Sajak
And a vowel?

Randy
An O please.

Pat Sajak
Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here.  The category is People Who Annoy You.  Audience, keep quiet, please. 

Randy
Uh... Well, uh...

Pat Sajak
Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.

Randy
I know it but I don't think I should say it.

Pat Sajak
Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.

Randy
Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...

Stan
Oooo. 

Randy
Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.

Pat Sajak
Uhh, can we cut to a... Can we cut to a- 

Randy
Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?

Sharon
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.

Randy
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.

Kyle
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?

Cartman
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.

Stan
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!

Cartman
Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.

Stan
No he's not.  Is he?

Kyle
I don't know.

Stan
I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-

Token
Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.

Stan
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?

Token
Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.

Cartman
Ohhhhhhhh?

Token
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.

Cartman
Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 

Stan
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.

Token
That's easy for you to say, Stan.

Cartman
Yeah, come on! Here we go!

Stan
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.

Token
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.

Cartman
Race war! Come on! Race war!

Token
If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not fighting anybody. 

Cartman
Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!

Randy
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 

Jesse Jackson
The puzzle you were solving was people who annoy you.

Randy
Uh well, like anybody else thought it was naggers. I mean, right?

Jesse Jackson
Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.

Randy
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.

Jesse Jackson
Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?

Randy
Y-Yes, absolutely.

Jesse Jackson
Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. 

Randy
Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.

Jesse Jackson
Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. 

Brian
Ready to go, sir.

Jesse Jackson
Kiss it.

Randy
Huh?

Jesse Jackson
Apologize. Kiss it.

Randy
You want me to kiss your-

Jesse Jackson
That's right.  Apologize.

Randy
Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...

Jesse Jackson
Apologize. 

Stan
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.

Token
Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.

Stan
Well, yeah.

Token
You just don't get it, Stan!

Stan
Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!

Token
Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 

Stan
He told my dad he was...

Woman
Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?

Butters
A midget?

Woman
Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!

Mr. Nelson
Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today?  I would like to share with you all my-

Cartman
No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 

Mr. Nelson
That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-

Cartman
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...

Mr. Mackey
Eric, be quiet!

Mr. Nelson
No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. 

Cartman
Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 

Comedian
So I said to my wife, You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!  We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people are actually from Colorado?  Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh?  Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?  Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said nigger on Wheel of Fortune.  Look! Everybody! It's the nigger guy. 

Man 2
Hey, it is him.

Comedian
Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the nigger guy.  Say, Hi, 'nigger' guy!

Randy
Hi, nigger guy! 

Comedian
That's all right, nigger guy. You know we're just playin'. 

Randy
Yeah... No problem...

Comedian
Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're straight out of Far Out Space Nuts. Maybe nigger guy has one. You got one, nigger guy? 

Man 3
Hey look, Betty. It's that nigger guy. 

Three kids
Nigger guy. Nigger guy. 

Clerk
Hey. What do you think you're doing? 

Randy
I just... need some aspirin.

Clerk
You aren't welcome in this store, nigger guy.

Randy
Fine! 

Mr. Nelson
Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.

Principal Victoria
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.

Mr. Nelson
Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks.

Mr. Mackey
Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?

Mr. Nelson
You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-

Mr. Mackey
Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.

Principal Victoria
Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.

Cartman
Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 

Mr. Nelson
You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.

Cartman
Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 

Mr. Nelson
You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.

Cartman
Barely! 

Mr. Nelson
No matter how you act, I can rise above it!

Cartman
Rise above it! Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 

Mr. Nelson
Shut your fucking mouth!

Principal Victoria
Mr. Nelson! 

Mr. Nelson
He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking

Cartman
Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!

Mr. Nelson
Aaaaaaa!

Randy
Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just Nigger Guy.  Respect. 

Stan
Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that little person talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.

Token
Sooo black people are midgets. 

Stan
God dammit!

Mr. Nelson
Excuse me: over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. 

Mr. Nelson
I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, Hello, fatso!

Craig
...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.

Mr. Nelson
He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  All right all right, here he comes. 

Kids
Hello, fatso!

Cartman
Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!

Mr. Nelson
Now you know how it feels.  You didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?

Cartman
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!

Mr. Nelson
You can't get to me! Words are like bullets!

Randy
And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the nigger guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on Wheel of Fortune, you know and... and when people call me... nigger guy... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 

Black Man
Is this nigger guy serious?

Randy
Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 

Driver
Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!

Skeeter
Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 

Randy
Awww! Awwww! 

Skeeter
Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.

Passenger
Wooo! 

Randy
Whoa! 

Skeeter
Where you goin' nigger guy?

Randy
Please I, I don't want any trouble.

Skeeter
Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on Wheel of Fortune!

Driver
Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, nigger guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.

Passenger
You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!

Randy
What do you want?

Skeeter
What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!

Man 4
Leave him alone.

Passenger
Hey... That's that other nigger guy.

Skeeter
Huh?

Passenger
That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.

Driver
Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!

Skeeter
Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two nigger guys!

Man 5
Make that three.

Passenger
Mark Fuhrman?

Skeeter
Who?

Passenger
He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.

Driver
Well what is this? A nigger guy convention? 

Richards
We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.

Driver
Come on, Skeeter.  These nigger guys ain't worth our trouble.

Skeeter
Damn nigger guys!  We'll be back! 

Richards
You'd better come with us.

Richards
Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.

Randy
What's going on here?

Fuhrman
We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.

Scott
They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.

Richards
We're all just like you.

Randy
No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.

Richards
I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.

Randy
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!

Richards
You really think that matters?!  You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damned nigger guy!  Oh, you don't like that, do ya?

Randy
No.

Fuhrman
Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.

Stan
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!

Token
I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!

Stan
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!

Token
No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!

Stan
What the hell do you want from me?! 

Token
Nothing!

Stan
Then stop being mad!

Token
No!

Butters
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 

Butters
All right, Eric, come on, Eric.

Kyle
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.

Cartman
It's a midget, dude.

Mr. Nelson
Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.

Cartman
Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 

Randy
Senators, I know it is not normally considered American to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term nigger guy.

Senator 1
Nigger guy?

Randy
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.

Richards
Yeah! That's right!

Randy
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.

Skeeter
Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!

Randy
Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called nigger guys? 

Senator 2
Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that nigger guy could become a slur that refers to all white people?

Senator 3
I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.

Senator 4
Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington.

Senator 1
Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill.  All those in favor to ban the term nigger guy?

Most Senators
Aye!

Senator 1
Opposed?

Senator 4
Nay?

Senator 1
The motion is passed! 

Randy
We did it!

Field Reporter
For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.

Senator 3
From now on, if a person uses the word nigger, it must be at least seven words away from the word guy. 

Field Reporter
Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove-  Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?

Mr. Nelson
AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win!

Cartman
Say Uncle!

Mr. Nelson
Ung-cle!

Cartman
Hahaha, now say Caroline, don't go into the light!

Mr. Nelson
Caroline, don't go into the light!

Cartman
Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!

Mr. Nelson
There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.  I have proven my point! My work here is done! 

Stan
What was his point?

Kyle
I have no idea.

Stan
Dude, I don't get it.

Kyle
I don't get it either.

Stan
Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.

Kyle
...Huh?

Stan
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.

Token
Now you get it, Stan. 

Stan
Yeah. I totally don't get it.

Token
Thanks, dude.

Cartman
This picture I like to call The Pierre. I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture The Sleeping Menstrual.  This one, I call Hot Fudge Mondae.  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.

Kyle
Is this all you brought us here to see?

Cartman
Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it New Moon Rising.  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.

Kyle
Butters is staying over tonight?

Cartman
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-

Butters
Hey, fellas! 

Cartman
Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.

Butters
Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?

Cartman
No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?

Stan
Come on, let's go. 

Kyle
Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.

Butters
Yeah Kyle?

Kyle
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?

Cartman
Kyyyle!

Butters
Uh what do you mean?

Kyle
I mean, that if-

Cartman
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.

Butters
Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.

Kyle
Hrrugh! 

Butters
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?

Cartman
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.

Butters
But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.

Cartman
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.

Cartman
You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!

Stan
What'cha do to Butters this time?

Cartman
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 

Kyle
Dude!

Cartman
I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!

Stan
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?

Cartman
Because that makes Butters gay now!

Kyle
No dude, that makes you gay!

Cartman
Eh- ...what?

Kyle
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!

Cartman
Nuh uh.

Kyle
Yeah huh!

Cartman
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?

Kenny
(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)

Cartman
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!

Stan
You are now.

Cartman
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!

Kyle
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.

Cartman
No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?

Stan
You can't!

Kyle
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.

Cartman
How?

Kyle
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.

Cartman
Really?

Kyle
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.

Cartman
...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 

Kyle
...Idiot.

Butters
Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 

Cartman
Butters.

Butters
Whoa, hey Eric.

Cartman
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.

Butters
A surprise? What is it?

Cartman
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!

Butters
Oh boy!

Cartman
You ready?

Butters
Y-yeah!

Cartman
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!

Butters
Oh, okay! 

Cartman
Hang on a second here. 

Butters
How come uh, I can't see?

Cartman
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 

Butters
Oh uh, ho yeah.

Cartman
All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.

Butters
Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?

Cartman
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 

Butters
Well okay!

Cartman
All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 

Stephen
Butters!

Cartman
Uh! 

Butters
Whoa! Hey Dad! 

Stephen
Butters! What are you doing?!

Butters
I'm getting a surprise! 

Stephen
Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 

Butters
Hey. Where'd Eric go?

Stephen
Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?

Butters
Like what?

Stephen
Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.

Butters
What's... bi-curious?

Stephen
You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. 

Linda
What's going on, you two?

Butters
Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 

Stephen
Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.

Father Maxi
Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?

Butters
...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.

Stephen
You see?

Father Maxi
Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.

Butters
Really?

Stephen
What can I do, Father?

Father Maxi
There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.

Stephen
A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.

Butters
Whoa boy! Camp!

Cartman
Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!

Kyle
What are you talking about, fatass?

Cartman
I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!

Kyle
You figured that out, huh?

Cartman
That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 

Kyle
Except for us.

Cartman
Right, except for you.

Kyle
And all the people we tell.

Cartman
Why would you tell anybody?

Stan
Because it's really, really funny.

Cartman
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.

Kyle
Like what?

Cartman
Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 

Stan
That isn't funny.

Cartman
Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!

Kyle
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Cartman
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.

Kyle
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.

Cartman
Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 

Leader
Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.

Campers
Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.

Stephen
Thank you so much for taking him in.

Director
Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.

Director
Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?

Butters
Because I'm bi-curious?

Director
That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.  Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.  Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life.  Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there.  Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?

Bradley
Humble yourselves therefore under God's might hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6

Director
Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

Butters
I'm bi-curious.

Bradley
Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.

Director
That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed.  We've got another one: Room 22.

Staffer
Aw, darnit!

Stan
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 

Kyle
Okay, my turn. 

Cartman
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!

Kyle
Where's what?

Cartman
You know God damned well what!

Kyle
Let go of me.

Stan
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

Cartman
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!

Kyle
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!

Cartman
Give it back, Kyle!

Kyle
I don't have it!

Cartman
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!

Kyle
Shut up!

Cartman
You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!

Campers
The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.

Director
We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.

Butters
He's bi-curious too?

Director
Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!

Pastor Phillips
Helloooo campers!  Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man!  So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what?  It worrrrked! 

Director
That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip.  And just like a paper clip,  God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. 

Det. Yates
So you say you were robbed. 

Cartman
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!

Det. Yates
If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?

Cartman
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!

Det. Yates
Okay, what is the picture of?

Cartman
Why... why does that matter?

Det. Yates
Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?

Cartman
All right. It's a picture ...of me.

Det. Yates
Yes?

Cartman
It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.

Det. Yates
You were sucking somebody's penis. 

Cartman
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!

Det. Yates
...I see.

Cartman
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!

Det. Yates
Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.

Cartman
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!

Det. Yates
Well then, you're screwed.

Director
You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?

Butters
Well sure, I guess.

Bradley
Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.

Director
And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?

Butters
Well yeah, sure.

Bradley
So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.

Director
Then do you mind telling us why we found this  1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?

Bradley
That's... that's mine.

Director
You know this is strictly forbidden!

Butters
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?

Director
What's wrong?!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!

Butters
Yes, it's all very confusing!

Director
This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!

Cartman
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!

Liane
Eric? What's the, what's the matter? 

Cartman
I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.

Liane
Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.

Cartman
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.

Liane
Oh, now why would he do that?

Cartman
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.

Liane
What is the picture of, Eric? 

Cartman
Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.

Liane
Ohh, that's nice.

Cartman
But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 

Liane
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.

Cartman
But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 

Liane
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

Cartman
You, you will?

Butters
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!

Bradley
Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.

Butters
Awww, that's okay, Bradley.

Bradley
I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.

Butters
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!

Bradley
You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Oh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!

Butters
Wuh-what's the matter?

Bradley
I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.

Butters
Well I like you too, Bradley.

Bradley
You do?

Butters
Well yeah!

Bradley
You like like me?

Butters
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 

Bradley
Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! 

Butters
No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!

Sheila
Hello?

Liane
Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.

Sheila
Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.

Liane
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.

Sheila
Excuse me?

Liane
Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.

Cartman
It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 

Liane
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.

Cartman
What?

Liane
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.

Cartman
Mom, she's lying!

Liane
She said she was sure, Eric.

Cartman
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!

Liane
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.

Cartman
Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie

Director
Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!

Butters
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.

Director
You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.

Butters
Oh no, my Dad?

Director
Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?

Butters
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.

Director
We're fixing your confusion!

Stephen
There you are, Butters!

Director
Oheh- hey Dad.

Stephen
What's he done now?!

Director
Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!

A counselor
They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! 

Director
Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!

Bradley
Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!

Director
Nono, we're fixing you!

Cartman
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!

Mrs. Garrison
Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell.  Who'd like to go first? 

Kyle
Ow! Quit it, dude!

Mrs. Garrison
Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.

Cartman
HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call Moods of Winter , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?

Kyle
He isn't actually going to show everyone...

Cartman
And now this next picture 

Director
Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!

Bradley
It's too late.

Butters
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?

Director
You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.

Bradley
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!

Butters
You're perfectly normal, Bradley.

Director
Get back! You're just as confused as he is!

Butters
All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!

Bradley
Yeah.

Butters
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 

Bradley
I think. I think I'd like to come down now.

Director
He's coming down!  We did it!  Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!

Stephen
Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.

Butters
No. I like bein' bi-curious.

Stephen
Well you know somethin'? So do I. 

Butters
Wait. Now I am confused.

Cartman
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 

Bebe
Eww!

Clyde
Dude.

Cartman
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.

Mrs. Garrison
Eric, what the hell is this?!

Cartman
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-

Mr. Mackey
Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk. She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 

Cartman
...Lame.

Mrs. Garrison
All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.

Cartman
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.

Mrs. Garrison
No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.

Bebe
Somebody might have lice?

Class
Ewww!

Mrs. Garrison
So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.

Cartman
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.

Kenny
(What? Fuck you!)

Mrs. Garrison
I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads.  Lice can live in anybody's hair. 

Male Louse
Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?

Kelly
You mean me or the little one?

Male Louse
I mean both.

Kelly
Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.

Male Louse
How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?

Kelly
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?

Travis
Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in.  I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. 

Lead Screener
All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. 

Butters
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.

Stan
What do you think happens if you do have it?

Cartman
They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 

Craig
I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 

Cartman
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.

Kenny
(Hey! Fuck off!) 

Lead Screener
Have a seat on the stool. 

Lead Screener
Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.

Clyde
What?

Lead Screener
You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?

Clyde
Oh my God. Oh Christ no!

Lead Screener
Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor.

Clyde
Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!

Lead Screener
I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.

Clyde
Yes they are!

Travis
Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem!  The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.

President
And what do you base this on?

Travis
Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.

Older Louse
Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense.  Hello. Anybody? 

Travis
If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!

Older Louse
Poodiggery and poppycock!

Travis
I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.

Older Louse
Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.

Travis
Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!

Clyde
This is so... embarrassing.

Girl
I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?

Clyde
I have... I have AIDS. 

Nurse
Clyde Harris? 

Doctor
Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.

Clyde
But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!

Doctor
Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.

Clyde
...Sick!

Doctor
This shampoo should take care of it.  Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them.

Kelly
Travis? Everything okay?

Travis
Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.

Kelly
Hope?

Travis
Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? 

Louse 1
It's raining? Now? 

Louse 2
Woohoo! I love the rain! 

Travis
Oh my God.  We have to get out of here!

Kelly
What it, it's just rain.

Travis
We have to get out of here now, Kellih! 

Louse 3
What is that? 

Lice
Whoa!  Ruuun! 

Travis
Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! 

Kelly
My God, Travis, they're all dying!

Travis
Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!

Louse 4
What the hell is it?!

Louse 5
Well it's okay, we're safe up here! 

Travis
I don't think so! 

Louse 4
OoOhOOOoooh!

Kelly
Travis!

Travis
Kellih! Hang on!

Kelly
I can't... hang on!

Travis
You have to! For the babih! 

Kelly
Nooooooooooo!

Travis
Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! 

Mrs. Garrison
Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?

Cartman
Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?

Mrs. Garrison
With what?

Craig
With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? 

Mrs. Garrison
Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.

Stan
Somebody in this class?

Mrs. Garrison
Uh, yes.

Class
Ohhhhh.

Cartman
Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?

Mrs. Garrison
That doesn't matter, it's over.

Cartman
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?

Red
I wanna know who it was, too.

Mrs. Garrison
It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!

Cartman
That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!

Class
Yeah!

Bebe
And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!

Craig
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!

Butters
Yeah! Dumb girls!

Mrs. Garrison
The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history.  Ulysses S. Grant-

Travis
Hope. Hope, you're alive.  My God...  Heh?!

Louse 6
Help me... Help meeee... 

Louse 7
Travis.  Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.

Travis
How many survivors?

Louse 7
Just the six of us. And the Vice President.

Travis
You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!

Louse 8
What do we do now?

Travis
We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. 

Vice President
Who put you in charge?!

Travis
God did! When he killed my wife! 

Cartman
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 

Craig
Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.

Cartman
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!

Kyle
You know what? I'll bet it was you!

Cartman
Me?!

Kyle
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!

Cartman
I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!

Stan
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!

Cartman
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 

Kyle
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.

Cartman
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 

Butters
Heh hey guys, what would I do?

Bebe
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.

Kyle
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.

Clyde
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.

Cartman
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 

Kyle
It was him. It had to have been him!

Stan
Yeah... Or you. 

Louse 9
Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.

Travis
This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.

Louse 8
How?

Travis
First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!

Louse 9
The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.

Travis
We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!

Louse 10
Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?

Travis
Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!

Louse 9
I'm not leaving my husband.

Louse 11
Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.

Travis
You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. 

Louse 12
I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here.

Vice President
I wanna go too.

Travis
Not a chance.

Vice President
Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.

Travis
If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  Let's go.  Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! 

Vice President
Yeah. Right behind you. 

Cartman
All right, lock that door, Craig! 

Kyle
What's this about, Cartman? 

Cartman
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.

Jimmy
Ur ur re- ur really?

Kyle
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!

Cartman
This is a scientific test, designed to-

Kyle
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!

Cartman
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!

Kyle
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!

Cartman
If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!

Craig
Yeah. That's true.

Jimmy
I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide

Token
Yeah. Me neither.

Kyle
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.

Cartman
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.

Cartman
All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 

Butters
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.

Kyle
It doesn't prove anything!

Cartman
Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 

Clyde
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.

Cartman
It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 

Token
What the hell?! 

Cartman
Kenny!

Kyle
No way.

Craig
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.

Cartman
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 

Louse 12
We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone.  I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real.

Travis
It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.

Vice President
So what exactly is your plan, Travis?

Travis
Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.

Louse 12
Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.

Travis
Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly.

Louse 12
She was a lucky woman to have you.

Travis
Luck had nothin' to do with it. 

Vice President
Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!

Travis
Why you murdering bastard!

Vice President
Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!

Travis
What the hell do you want, Vice President?!

Vice President
Walk! 

Craig
Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 

Clyde
What? What are you gonna do to him?

Cartman
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 

Clyde
You guys, wait. 

Cartman
What, Clyde?

Clyde
I... nothing.

Cartman
All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!

Token, Craig
Yeah!

Jimmy
Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! 

Mrs. Garrison
Yello?

Clyde
Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.

Mrs. Garrison
What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!

Clyde
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!

Vice President
That's good! That's far enough! 

Travis
What are you going to do?

Vice President
I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!

Travis
Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!

Vice President
It was a disaster! Disasters happen!

Travis
Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!

Vice President
Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! 

Travis
Damn you! Why?!

Vice President
Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not conscious, we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! 

Clyde
Ow. 

Vice President
You die he- 

Cartman
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!

Kenny
(Not guilty!)

Cartman
Guilty! I thought so! 

Craig
All right, let's do this!

Clyde
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?

Cartman
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 

Kenny
Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!

Clyde
Wait, wait!

Kyle
Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.

Craig
He had cooties and he lied about it!

Kyle
Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.

Clyde
What?

Kyle
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.

Stan
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!

Clyde
Wait a-wait a minute, what?

Cartman
Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!

Stan
You had head lice?

Cartman
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!

Mrs. Garrison
You all had head lice!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!

Craig
I thought I was the only one.

Butters
Me too.

Cartman
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 

Kenny
Dudes!

Travis
Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe.  Keh... k-Kellih? 

Louse 13
You are welcome here.  You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed.

Travis
Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! 

Agent
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! 

Angelina Jolie
Hello everyone!  Hello!

Mrs. Garrison
All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.

Cartman
Uh oh! 

Mrs. Garrison
Welcome to our class, Baahir.

Baahir
Thank you.

Cartman
Duhude, dude,  not cool!

Mrs. Garrison
Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?

Baahir
Okay. 

Cartman
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.

Mrs. Garrison
Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!

Cartman
What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?

Mrs. Garrison
Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!

Cartman
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.

Butters
Now you go, Baahir. 

Kyle
Yeah?

Cartman
Kyle, are you on your computer?

Kyle
What? No, I'm sick. 

Cartman
Get online. I need you to check something for me.

Kyle
Dude, leave me alone.

Cartman
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!

Kyle
What? Why?

Cartman
Get online now!

Kyle
All right, all right. 

Cartman
Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.

Kyle
Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?

Cartman
Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?

Kyle
Over a hundred.

Cartman
Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?

Kyle
White Stripes

Cartman
That's funny.

Kyle
What?

Cartman
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.

Cartman
The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.

Barbrady
Hello?

Cartman
Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 

Barbrady
From what? Who is this?

Cartman
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!

Barbrady
Are you serious?

Cartman
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?

Barbrady
Like what?

Cartman
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.

Barbrady
Oh jeez.

Mrs. Garrison
What the hell?

Principal Victoria
All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 

Butters
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?

Baahir
Sure, okay. 

Butters
Well all right! 

Kyle
Dude. 

Cartman
Yeah. 

Kyle
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.

Cartman
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!

Kyle
I guess so.

Cartman
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!

Kyle
Wuh what doesn't follow?

Cartman
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!

Kyle
Okay.

Cartman
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!

Kyle
Yeah. Actually, there is.

Cartman
What?

Kyle
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 

Agent
Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.

Head Agent
What?  This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.

Cartman
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!

Mr. Thompson
What do you know?

Cartman
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!

Mr. Thompson
I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!

Cartman
I said I will only talk to the President!

Mr. Thompson
Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-

Cartman
LALALALALALALALA!

Mr. Thompson
I will have you arrested for-!

Cartman
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!

Aide
Call is coming through now, Mr. President.

Bush
Hello?

Cartman
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?

Bush
Huh? Who.

Cartman
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!

Bush
Hildog?

Aide
Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.

Hillary
What is it, Brian?

Brian
Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.

Hillary
Is the thread credible?

Brian
We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. 

Hillary
No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.

Driver
We've reached the rally site, Hildog.

Aide 2
Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.

Hillary
Thank you, Chris. 

Chris
They know about the bomb!

Blond Russian
That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.

Chris
Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.

Blond Russian
That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!

Chris
The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!

Blonde Russian
Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.

Chris
I understand, comrade.

Blonde Russian
Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.

Cartman
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!

Kyle
So then maybe you're wrong.

Cartman
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?

Kyle
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.

Cartman
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?

Kyle
Yeah.  What is that?

Cartman
It's my balls! 

Kyle
God damn it Cartman!

Cartman
Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.

Mayor McDaniels
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! 

Hillary
It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. 

Hildog Fan
Here we go! 

Brian
Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? 

Otis
We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. 

Hillary
This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! 

Aide 3
Oh my God, she got a scent! 

Brian
What?!

Aide 3
The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!

Brian
Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!

Aide 3
Come on, find it. Find! 

Brian
My God, they hid it under the stage?!

Female Aide
No wait, look. 

Hillary
How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh...  on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha,  uh, uh, on the education of all children.  Oh, I declare!

Otis
Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...

Agent
Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...

Mr. Thompson
In her what?

Agent
In her snatch, sir.

Mr. Thompson
What?!

Hillary
What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.

Brian
Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes.

Mr. Thompson
Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.

Brian
A what?!

Mr. Thompson
A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.

Brian
No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!

Mr. Waters
Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.

Hillary
What is goin' on, Brian?

Brian
Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.

Hillary
Oh my.

Brian
What do we do? Can we disable the timer?

Mr. Thompson
It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.

Brian
But then that means...

Mr. Thompson
Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.

Mr. Thompson
Do we have that phone trace?

CIA Vice Head
The call is going through now, sir.

Cartman
Yeah? 

Mr. Thompson
This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- 

Cartman
Yes, Mr. Thompson?

Mr. Thompson
Well, we've just arrived in your town.

Cartman
Why? Did you find something?

Mr. Thompson
Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.

Cartman
A snuke?

Mr. Thompson
That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.

Cartman
I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?

Mr. Thompson
We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.

Cartman
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 

Mr. Thompson
Oh, hey.

Stan
Dude, we totally got let out of school.

Kyle
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.

Stan
Russian?

Kyle
Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.

Stan
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.

Kyle
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?

Stan
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.

Kyle
Oh that's a good idea. 

Mr. Hakeem
What is going on? What have we done?

Mr. Thompson
They claim they don't know anything about an attack.

Cartman
Big surprise!

Police Officer
Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.

Mr. Thompson
Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?

Mr. Hakeem
We thought he was at school. He's not at school?

Brian
You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.

Hillary
Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?

Brian
They'll find the detonator, Hildog.

Aide 3
We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?

EOD Leader
I'm not sending any of my men in there.

Chris
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?

Vladimir
Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. 

Agent 2
Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!

Mr. Hakeem
I tell you, I do not know.

Agent 2
This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.

Cartman
Let me have time with him.

Female Agent
What are you going to do?

Cartman
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!

Mr. Hakeem
He should be at school!  Hey!

Cartman
Where is the detonator?!

Mr. Hakeem
Wuh-what detonator are you ta-

Cartman
I can do this aaall day.

Mr. Hakeem
I don't know anything about a-  Aawwwwgh  Stop it! Really!

Cartman
You can make it stop!

Mr. Hakeem
I don't have the- 

Female Agent
Are we just gonna let this go on? 

Kyle
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.

Stan
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 

CIA Vice Head
Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. 

Kyle
Hey.

CIA Vice Head
Donner, take over that station. 

Kyle
What's going on?

CIA Vice Head
This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!

Kyle
...Homeland Security?

CIA Vice Head
Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!

FBI Leader
'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!

CIA Vice Head
I am!

FBI Leader
Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.

CIA Vice Head
That's outrageous! On whose orders?!

FBI Leader
On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!

ATF Leader
Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!

Secret Service Leader
Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.

Nelson
Not anymore I'm not! 

Mr. Hakeem
What are you going to do to my wife?!

Cartman
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!

Mrs. Hakeem
We told you: we don't know.

Cartman
Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 

Female Agent
Did he just inject himself with apple juice?

Cartman
Where is your son?!

Mr. Hakeem
She doesn't know either. 

Mrs. Hakeem
Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!

Mr. Hakeem
I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! 

Cartman
Answer it! 

Mrs. Hakeem
Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?

Cartman
Butters.

Mrs. Hakeem
Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage.  Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! 

Mr. Hakeem
Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!

Cartman
We got him! I know where he is!

Female Agent
All right, where? We'll send our people in.

Cartman
No no, he's my lead. 

Mr. Thompson
You're not going alone.

Cartman
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 

CIA Leader 2
All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.

Kyle
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!

CIA Leader 2
Are you tellin' me how to do my job?

Kyle
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.

CIA Leader 2
Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!

Chase
Checking.

Stan
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!

Female Agent 2
Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat.

CIA Leader 2
Where's the intel from?

Female Agent 2
We just read it on Drudge Report.

Kyle
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.

CIA Leader 2
We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!

Kyle
...Not anymore you're not.

CIA Leader 2
Oh, snap. 

Butters
Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 

Cartman
Uuugh! 

Butters
Oh hey Eric.

Cartman
Where is the detonator!

Baahir
The what?

Cartman
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!

Baahir
Leave me alone!  Upta!

Butters
Hey, I was about to win!

Cartman
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 

Terrorist #1
Get in the van! 

Cartman
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.

Terrorist #1
Get in the van!

Aide 3
That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!

EOD Leader
No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!

Brian
I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.

Cartman
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!

Vladimir
You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!

Cartman
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.

Vladimir
Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!

Cartman
Uhh yes, of course?

Vladimir
America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?

Cartman
The Russians?

Vladimir
Before that.

Cartman
The Germans?

Vladimir
Before that.

Cartman
The Germans again?

Vladimir
Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!

Cartman
You can't possible mean...?

Captain
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?

Queen Elizabeth II
The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.

Captain
Full sail, Your Majesty?

Aide 3
All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.

Brian
All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.

EOD Leader
God help him.

Aide 3
What do you see, Brian?

Brian
It's dark... cold...

Aide 3
You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.

Brian
Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! 

Aide 3
You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.

Brian
There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... 

Aide 3
Say again, Brian.

Brian
There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!

EOD Leader
Brian, get out of there!

Brian
Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!

EOD Leader
Brian? Brian, what's happening?

Brian
It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! 

Hillary
Hoh my!

Kyle
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.

Female Agent 2
The British?

Agent 4
Loyalist Red Coats!

Chase
Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!

Kyle
All right! MapQuest the address!

Chase
I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.

Kyle
Good thinking

CIA Leader 2
Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.

Vladimir
It was good knowing you, comrade.

Baahir
Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.

Vladimir
Yes, but we will be rich.

Agent
Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! 

Mr. Thompson
The game is over! Get down on the ground!

Vladimir
How did they find us?

Mr. Thompson
We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!

Vladimir
It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes!  What the hell?!

Agent
The power went out!

Mr. Thompson
Well so then what time is it? 

Vladimir
Oh crap.

Mr. Thompson
Take 'em down! 

Vladimir
No! I don't want to die without being paid! 

Mr. Thompson
The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.

Captain
The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!

Soldier
How?

Captain
Fire at will! 

Queen Elizabeth II
Yes?

Captain
Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.

Queen Elizabeth II
I see. 

Mr. Thompson
Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.

Kyle
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.

Cartman
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.

Baahir
Really?

Cartman
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.

Kyle
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!

Cartman
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?

Kyle
...Maybe. 

Cartman
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.

Kyle
...That is so missing the point.

Cartman
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!

Kyle
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-

Cartman
Yes or no, Kyle?!

Kyle
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.

Cartman
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 

Mr. Hakeem
Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! 

Butters
Awwwww.

Cartman
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.

Randy
...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.

Randy
Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 

Stan
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?

Randy
Wha... what do you mean, Why do we do this? It's Easter!

Stan
Right, so, why do we color eggs? 

Randy
Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.

Stan
Yeah, but why?

Randy
Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.

Stan
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?

Randy
That's right.

Stan
You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.

Randy
Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!

Stan
I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!

Randy
What is wrong with him?!

Sharon
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 

Randy
You know so little! 

Cartman
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!

Mall Bunny
Ahh, don't you think that's-

Cartman
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!

Aide
Smile! 

Cartman
Bye, Easter bunny! 

Mall Bunny
Oh my God. 

Stan
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?

Mall Bunny
Huh?

Stan
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!

Mall Bunny
Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.

Stan
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!

Mall Bunny
Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.

Stan
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 

Mall Bunny
I need a break. Can I have a break?  We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. 

Stan
Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?

Randy
Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 

Stan
Dad! You've gotta help me! 

Randy
Hang on, I'm taking a crap.

Stan
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!

Randy
What?

Stan
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?

Randy
We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.

Gray Hare
Randy?

Randy
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.

Purple Hare
Ohhh.

Randy
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.

Randy
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!

Stan
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!

Randy
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.

Stan
Does Mom know about this?

Randy
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.

Stan
I don't understand!

Randy
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!

Stan
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?

Randy
Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!

Stan
So what is the secret of Easter?

Randy
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.

Randy
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.

Stan
Grandpa's in it too?

Randy
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.

Stan
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?

Randy
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.

Stan
You mean the old Galveston Lodge? 

Randy
Dammit.

Hare 1
Hey Bill.

Hare 2
Evenin' Marcus.

Hare 3
Heh heh hey, look at you!

Hare 4
Hey everybody.

Hare 5
Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.

Stan
Must I?

Marvin
There he is! There's my grandson!

Stan
Hi Grandpa.

Marvin
I'm proud of ya, Billy.

Stan
...Stan.

Pink Hare
Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.

Hares
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.

Pink Hare
All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!

Hares
Hail Snowball. 

Pink Hare
Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?

Stan
Yeah.

Randy
Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.

Stan
Yeah, I wanna know already.

Pink Hare
Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- 

Gray Hare
They found us! 

White Hare
Protect Snowball! 

Brown Hare
They're everywhere! 

Randy
Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!

Stan
Where am I supposed to go?

Randy
Just get out of here! 

Layman
Where is the rabbit?!

Hare 6
Where are you taking us?

Hare 7
No! I'm not goin' anywhere! 

Stan
Jesus Christ! 

Layman
Who did you give the rabbit to?!  Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!

Stan
Oh no... 

Stan
Help.

Kyle
What happened?

Stan
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.

Kyle
...I'm kind of finger painting right now.

Stan
Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?

Kyle
Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.

Randy
Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.

Nelson
My legs. I... I think they're broken.

Randy
Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?

Nelson
Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 

Randy
You...

Kyle
Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 

Butler
What is it in regard to? 

Kyle
The history of Easter.

Teabag
Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. 

Stan
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 

Teabag
The Keepers?  The Guardians of the Secret?

Stan
My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.

Teabag
Come on in. 

Teabag
The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci.  Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?

Stan
Just bread...

Teabag
Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others.

Kyle
It kind of looks like... an egg.

Teabag
Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter.

Kyle
Who is Saint Peter?

Stan
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.

Teabag
Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. 

Kyle
Peter Rabbit.

Teabag
Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.

Kyle
I don't see it.

Teabag
Look closelier. 

Stan
He looks like a guy.

Teabag
Look more closelier.  With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it.  That... is Saint Peter.  The original Pope of Christianity.

Kyle
I don't believe it.

Teabag
Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed...  for a rabbit.

Stan
But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?

Teabag
Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.

Kyle
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?

Pope Benedict
You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?

Randy
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!

Pope Benedict
Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!

Randy
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.

Layman
I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!

Pope Benedict
The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!

Randy
I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.

Layman
Take him to be tortured!

Pope Benedict
Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.

Bill
You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 

Randy
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!

Stan
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?

Teabag
I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. 

Butler
Mr. Teabag! Get out! 

Stan
They found me!

Teabag
Boys, get out of here!  Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. 

Bill
Check upstairs!  Upstairs clear! Try the office! 

Ninja 1
In here! 

Ninja 2
What's that? 

Ninja 1
PEEEEPS! 

Kyle
So what now?

Stan
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.

Kyle
You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?

Stan
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 

Kyle
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.

Announcer
Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.

Reporter
As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection.  For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. 

Violet Hare
NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m-  AAAAAAAAAAH!

Pope Benedict
Bill, this seems extreme.

Bill
The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.

Italian Cardinal
Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!

Bill
Ya see? 

Randy
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!

Pope Benedict
Yes, hand it over!

Stan
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!

Pope Benedict
We promise.

Bill
We swear it, on the cross.

Randy
Just hand over the bunny, Stan!

Stan
Okay, fine. 

Randy
Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.

Stan
You said hand over the bunny.

Randy
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!

Bill
Take them into custody! 

Stan
Hey, what the hell!

Pope Benedict
Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.

Bill
Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These whores must be punished in front of everyone!

Kyle
You swore on the cross, fatso!

Bill
Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 

Randy
Oh, we should've seen that coming!

Pope Benedict
Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.

Bill
It is what Christ would've wanted!

Jesus
Who are you to say that?! 

Pope Benedict
It... can't be.

Stan, Kyle
Jesus! 

Singer
He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!

Cardinal
Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.

Jesus
I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.

Stan
Jesus, you did answer my prayer! 

Jesus
Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.

Purple Hare 2
Ohh, that's me Neato!

Jesus
This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.

Bill
Kill him!

Pope Benedict
What?!

Bill
He goes against the Church. He must die!

Pope Benedict
All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.

Bill
You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! 

Jesus
What are you doing?! 

Pope Benedict
I am the Pope!

Bill
You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!

Jesus
What is your problem, guy?!

Bill
Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.

Stan
No! No! 

Reporter
A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue

Bill
My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 

Randy
No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.

Pope Benedict
Forgive me, Jesus.

Jesus
We'll never get out in time to stop him!

Kyle
Don't you have any superpowers?

Jesus
Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.

Kyle
What?

Jesus
Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.

Kyle
N-no way! Do it yourself.

Jesus
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!

Kyle
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.

Jesus
Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.

Kyle
Don't make me do this.

Jesus
My son, there is no time! Do it!

Kyle
Eric Cartman can never know about this.

Jesus
I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.

Kyle
Happy Easter, Jesus. 

Jesus
Awgh! 

Kyle
...Jesus?

Bill
Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! 

Cardinal
Sorry, little bunny.

Stan
Snowball! 

Tourist
Jesus?

Jesus
Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!

Bill
Why won't you go away?!

Jesus
One man cannot be the voice of the Church!

Bill
Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!

Jesus
Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. 

Crowd
YAAAY!

Stan
All right Jesus!

Crowd
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.

Cardinal
Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives?  It isn't saying anything.

Italian Cardinal
Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.

Randy
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.

Stan
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.

Randy
That's my boy.

Crowd
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.

Mrs. Garrison
Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it!  Stupid ass man! They're all the same! 

Kyle
Oh God, here we go again.

Mrs. Garrison
All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'? I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!

Stan
Uh oh, this isn't good.

Mrs. Garrison
Did I say something to you, sugartits?!

Stan
No ma'am.

Mrs. Garrison
You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, The Old Man and the Sea!

Cartman
Have you lost your mind?

Stan
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.

Mrs. Garrison
Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!

Butters
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.

Mrs. Garrison
If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!

Stan
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?

Kyle
Our whole weekend is shot.

Kenny
(What the hell are we going to do?!)

Cartman
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.

Stan
We don't?

Cartman
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.

Cartman
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

Laborer 1
Yeis.

Laborer 2
We looking work, sí.

Cartman
Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  The Old Man and the Sea for us. Comprende? The Old Mand Y La Mer.

Laborer 2
Okay.

Laborer 1
Sure.

Laborer 3
Okay.

Laborer 4
Yeah.

Cartman
Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.

Laborer 2
Okay no problem. That's no problem.

Laborer 1
Yeah, we can do that.

Laborer 5
Sí, la samuraisia.

Cartman
Okay, gracias.

Stan and Kyle
Gracias.

Stan
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.

Cartman
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.

Mrs. Garrison
They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! 

Woman
Are you okay, hon?

Mrs. Garrison
I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!

Woman
Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.

Mrs. Garrison
Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.

Woman
I'm Allyson.

Mrs. Garrison
Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.

Allyson
No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.

Janet
Yeah, I've been told that.

Allyson
How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?

Janet
Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.

Allyson
Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called Lebow.

Allyson
Hi Linda, hi Kate.

Woman 2
Hey Allyson.

Woman 3
Who's the new girl?

Woman 2
Allyson always goes for the butch ones.

Allyson
Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?

Janet
Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.

Allyson
Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. 

Janet
He-yeah. Done what?

Allyson
You know.  Had sex. 

Janet
Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?

Allyson
Yeah. I... thought you understood that.

Janet
Oh jeez. 

Allyson
I'm sorry. I thought you knew what girl bar meant.

Janet
But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. 

Allyson
Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-

Janet
I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!

Allyson
Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?

Janet
Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.

Allyson
There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.

Janet
I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.

Allyson
Could I... maybe kiss you? 

Janet
Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!

Allyson
Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight.  No commitments.  Just fun. 

Janet
Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!

Allyson
Janet, you're crazy!

Janet
Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!

Kyle
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!

Cartman
They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?

Laborers
Sí, sí.

Kyle
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.

Laborer 1
Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.

Laborer 2
Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.

Laborer 5
So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.

Kyle
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.

Laborer 1
No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. 

Stan
That's it, that's the whole story?

Laborer 1
Sí.

Cartman
All right, did you write the four essays?

Laborer 1
Sí, we all wrote essays for you. 

The Boys
All right!

Cartman
Okay, let's have 'em.

Laborer 4
Have what?

Kyle
You said you all wrote essays.

Laborer 1
Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.

Laborer 2
I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.

Laborer 5
I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. Thanks for writing me, ese. 

Kenny
(Uh oh...)

Kyle
Dude, we're totally fucked now!

Cartman
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!

Laborer 1
We thought it was kind of strange.

Kyle
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!

Stan
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!

Kyle
Son of a bitch! 

Stan
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?

Clyde
No, I got it done. 

Kyle
Jimmy, did you finish your book report?

Jimmy
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 

Cartman
Crap! 

Kyle
We're dead.

Mrs. Garrison
Hello, class. Here's my little desk , my nice lil chalkboard. 

Cartman
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.

Mrs. Garrison
Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.

Kyle
Really?

Mrs. Garrison
Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.  I'm gay. 

Stan
Again?

Mrs. Garrison
It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called Les Bos where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we...  scissored all night long.

Butters
You have to be careful with scissors.

Mrs. Garrison
But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.

Cartman
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!

Class
Yay!

Mrs. Garrison
Teeheeheehee.

Janet
Hey Tracy, hey Kate.

Tracy
Hi Janet.

Janet
Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 

Linda
Huh?

Janet
Hey Patty.

Patty
What's up, Janet.

Janet
Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.

Big Woman
Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? 

Janet
Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 

Lesbian 4
You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.

Lesbian 5
What is it, Katie?

Katie
They're closing down the bar. For good!

Linda
Closing it down? They can't do that.

Lesbian 6
This is our home.

Janet
Yeah, this is our home.

Katie
Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.

Janet
Persians?!

Tracy
So where are we supposed to go?

Janet
We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!

Janet
Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!

Mayor McDaniels
You're a lesbian now?

Janet
That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!

Mayor McDaniels
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.

Janet
Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!

Lesbians
Yeah, that's right!

Mayor McDaniels
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.

Janet
Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!

Mayor McDaniels
Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.

Tracy
Well, here's to some great times at this place.

Lesbian 7
Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.

Janet
Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!

Allyson
Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?

Janet
We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them We aren't leaving Les Bos.

Katie
Actually, it's Lebow.

Janet
No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!

Linda
The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.

Emir
Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.

Lesbian 6
Yes, we are.

Emir
Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.

Janet
I knew it! I knew it!

Emir
But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.

Janet
Would you allow straight people in? Men?

Emir
Well... we would allow whoev-

Janet
Choose your next words wisely, Persian! 

Emir
Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.

Janet
No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 

Emir
Ohhhhh!

Persian
How dare you! 

Narrator
And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. . All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.

Anchor
As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.

Lesbian 8
Good for them!

Lesbian 9
You go girls! 

Narrator
The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.

Persian 2
Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. 

Narrator
The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.

Lesbian 6
Here they come. 

Big Woman
There's so many of them.

Janet
Lesbos! Positions! 

Persian 2
Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!

Janet
The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!

Persian 2
All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!

Persians
Huuu! 

Janet
Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!

Persian 2
Come on, seriously, let us in!

Janet
Never!

Narrator
For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating.  Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated.  The Lesbos... had held.

Janet
Lesbohhhs!

Lesbians
Huok! Huok!

Narrator
The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.

Persian 2
Here he comes. 

Narrator
Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. 

Persian 2
Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.

Xerxes
Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.

Narrator
And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.

Xerxes
I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.

Janet
Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.

Allyson
Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.

Janet
We can't? I think it's pretty fun.

Linda
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.

Lesbian 10
Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.

Janet
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.

Allyson
Whattaya mean?

Janet
If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!

Allyson
But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.

Janet
It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.

Janet
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

Laborer 1
Yeis.

Laborer 2
We looking work, sí.

Janet
All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.

Laborer 2
Okay.

Laborer 1
Sure.

Laborer 3
Okay.

Laborer 4
Yeah.

Allyson
Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.

Janet
Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.

Laborer 1
Sí. 

Lesbian 6
Wow!

Janet
All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.

Laborer 1
Okay.

Laborer 5
No problem.

Laborer 2
Yes.

Laborer 4
Sí. 

Janet
And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.

Narrator
A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee.  With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?

Lesbian 6
The Persians are attacking again!

Janet
Take positions, Lesbos!

Lesbian 11
Get outside! 

Janet
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.

Linda
Really?

Allyson
How can you tell?

Janet
Let them through. It's okay.

Laborer 3
Hola, ¿como estas?

Laborer 4
Hola.

Janet
Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

Laborer 4
Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.

Janet
A-are you sure?

Laborer 1
No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.

Janet
What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?

Laborers
Sí.

Allyson
Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.

Janet
It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.

Xerxes
Why are you lesbians being so difficult?

Janet
Because we're protecting the only home we have.

Xerxes
I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.

Janet
You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.

Xerxes
Okay, how about this?  I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.

Janet
That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.

Xerxes
How..? How did you find that out?

Janet
I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.

Xerxes
You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.

Janet
Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!

Xerxes
You do? Seriously?

Janet
Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?

Xerxes
No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of  scissor or something.

Janet
Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!

Xerxes
Ohh, that feels so supercool!

Janet
Yeah, scissor!

Xerxes
Ohh, I'm a new woman!

Narrator
And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.

Janet
Thanks for everything, Xerxes.

Xerxes
No. Thank you, friend.

Allyson
Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?

Janet
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.

Laborer 1
Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. 

Laborer 2
Sí.

Laborers
Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.

Laborer 4
Sí.

Stan
These guys are pretty good.

Kyle
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 

Cartman
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.

Kyle
Fine.

Stan
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?

Bum
Spare some change?

Cartman
Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!

Kyle
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.

Stan
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?

Kenny
(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)

Cartman
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.

Kyle
Really?

Cartman
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.

Butters
Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 

Cartman
Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?

Stan
Yeah, it's all set.

Clyde
He won't make it.

Kyle
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!

Cartman
All right, here we go! Jimmy? 

Bum
Oh! Aww.

Cartman
Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!

Kenny
(Yehes!)

Stan
That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 

Kyle
God damn it, that wasn't my idea!

Mayor McDaniels
All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? 

Fire Chief
Well, I, I short of had an idea.

Mayor McDaniels
Please, Mr. Valmer.

Mr. Valmer
We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.

Other Members
Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.

Randy
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.

Mr. Valmer
Ohh, that's a good one.

Mr. Mackey
Nice one, Randy.

Gerald
Like it.

Aide
That's like recycling.

Mrs. Testaburger
All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!

Randy
You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.

Homeless Advisor
Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.

Kyle
Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 

Bum
Got any more?

Kyle
No, that... I thought that was a lot.

Bum
Spare any change?

Kyle
You're welcome. 

Kyle
Oh crap. 

Stan
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?

Kyle
I don't know.

Cartman
There's a bunch outside my house too.

Bum
Spare any change, sir?

Cartman
No! Fuck off! 

Stan
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.

Kyle
He did?

Cartman
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!

Kyle
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.

Cartman
You what?!

Kyle
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.

Stan
Kyle, what were you thinking?

Cartman
Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!

Kyle
I don't want you to jump them, retard!

Bum 1
Spare some change?

Randy
No, sorry, I don't have any change.

Bum 2
Got any change?

Randy
No, sorry. 

Bum 3
Can you spare some change? 

Bum 4
Chaaange?

Randy
Huh! I don't have any change. 

Bum 5
Change?

Randy
No!

Bum 6
Change? 

Bum 7
Spare some change?

Randy
Leave me alone I don't have any change!

Bum 7
All right, God bless you, sir.

Randy
Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.

Bum 7
Spare some change?

Randy
I just gave you change!

Bum 8
Change? 

Randy
Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 

Gerald
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.

Randy
Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!

Jimbo
Randy? Randy, what happened?

Randy
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!

Announcer
This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.

Chris Swollenballs
South Park has become overrun with the homeless.  Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible.  Many people are trapped throughout the town. 

Randy
Help! Help us!

Stan
Dude, it's our dads.

Kyle
Oh my God.

Chris Swollenballs
In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.

Bum 9
Spare some change?

Chris Swollenballs
What the? You can't be in here.

Bum 9
Ya got any change, sir?

Chris Swollenballs
No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?

Bum 10
Chaaaaange?

Chris Swollenballs
No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- 

Cartman
You see what you did, Kyle?!

Stan
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 

Cartman
They're everywhere!

Aide
What are you boys doing? Get in.

Bum 11
Spare any change, sir?

Aide
Ahhhh!  Come on, let's go!  What the hell were you doing outside?!

Stan
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.

Aide
You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. 

The Boys
Ahh! 

Aide
No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit!  Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. 

The Boys
Aaahhh! 

Kyle
Holy shit, dude! 

Stan
Over here!  Jump down! Go! 

Cartman
Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.

Kenny
(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)

Cartman
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.

Stan
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 

Randy
No sign of anybody else.

Gerald
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.

Randy
Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.

Stephen
And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.

Gerald
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.

Randy
You won't make it through, Gerald! 

Gerald
Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.

Bums
Change? Change sir? You got some change?

Gerald
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?

Bum 12
Change, sir?

Gerald
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 

Stephen
What happened?

Randy
He's become one of them.

Homeless Advisor
Go away, I I don't have any change.

Stan
Are you the head of Homeless Studies?

Homeless Advisor
Yes. Who are you?

Stan
We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-

Homeless Advisor
Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? 

Stan
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.

Cartman
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.

Homeless Advisor
Jump them?

Cartman
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.

Kyle
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.

Cartman
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.

Kyle
You barely made it over one, fatass!

Stan
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!

Kyle
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-

Homeless Advisor
Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. 

Randy
We don't have any change! Go away!

Linda
Anything, Stephen?

Stephen
No. All the phone lines are completely down. 

A Man
Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.

Randy
Find another place to hide, Steve!

Steve
I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.

Stephen
We can't just leave them out there.

Steve
Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.

Linda
You have to let them in, Randy.

Randy
There isn't enough food for more people up here!

Steve
Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.

Stephen
This isn't happening!

Randy
All right all right, fine! 

Bum 13
Could you spare some change, sir?

Randy
Harrrh!

Homeless Advisor
I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one.  The homeless... can survive solely... on change. 

Bum 14
Change?

Homeless Advisor
They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving

Bum 14
Is that... is that some spare change?

Homeless Advisor
Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.

Bum 14
Spare some of that change, sir?

Homeless Advisor
But now watch. 

Bum 14
Spare some change?

Homeless Advisor
It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here.  This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days.

Bum 15
Chaaaaange?

Kyle
What's it doing?

Homeless Advisor
It's dying.

Cartman
Cool.

Homeless Advisor
I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.

Gerald
Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 

Homeless Advisor
Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!

Kyle
What about you?

Homeless Advisor
Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!

Cartman
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.

Gerald
Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?

Bum 16
Change?

Bum 17
Spare some change?

Bum 18
Change?

Gerald
Stop it! I really do need change!

Bum 16
Me too. Change?

Gerald
Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?

Bum
Chaaange?

Homeless Advisor
Sorry to take the easy way out.  OW! OH, FUCK! OWW!  OHHH! AH! GOD! 

Randy
No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.

Jimbo
No. We can't be.

Randy
Face it, we're gonna starve!

Linda
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.

Randy
Those are cherry! Ich!

Head of Public Safety
Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. 

Gerald
What? You do?

Randy
How? Call the fire department.

Head of Public Safety
I'm calling my wife!  Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?

Linda
Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.

Stephen
Ask her what's happening.

Head of Public Safety
Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even-  Hello? Mary.  Mary!

Jimbo
What happened, Glen?

Glen
There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. 

Linda
Randy, what are you doing?

Randy
He's homeless now. We aren't safe.

Glen
I'm not like them.

Randy
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

Linda
And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?

Randy
If we have to! Siddown Glen!

Glen
Randy, you can't just-

Randy
SIT... doowwwnnnn!

Glen
This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? 

Stan
What the hell happened here? 

Man 1
That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!

Stan
We, just came to ask a question.

Man 2
You homeless or homeowners?

Kyle
We're nine.

Man 1
Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!

Stan
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.

Cartman
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.

Kyle
Shut up, Cartman!

Man 1
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?

Cartman
Youu heard about that?

Man 2
Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.

Cartman
Thirty was hard enough.

Kyle
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!

Stan
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!

Cartman
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.

Man 2
Well, that was easy. 

Man 1
The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 

Kyle
You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 

Man 1
That's right, yes.

Stan
What?

Kyle
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!

Man 1
And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!

Stan
But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!

Man 1
Right. But we survived.

Woman
Dehhhnyihhhs! 

Dennis
Christine!

Christine
You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!

Dennis
I had to, Christine, you were homeless.

Christine
No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!

Dennis
Christine, I can't understand you.

Christine
Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!

Dennis
I nurned your rip sauce?

Christine
No! You durned my yits oth!

Dennis
I have no idea what you're saying!  Ow! 

Stan
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!

Kyle
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.

Stan
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!

Kyle
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!

Kenny
(What are you gonna do?)

Kyle
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!

Randy
A bus! A bus is coming!

Jimbo
It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!

Stephen
I knew they'd come back for us!

Linda
All right!

A Woman
Yeah.

Randy
Look, Glen. We're saved. 

Stan
All right, I'm turning around

Stephen
Why are they turning?

Randy
What are they doing?  Don't leave us!

Kyle
All right, hit it.

Cartman
Let's hope to Christ this works.

Clerk
Ma'am, is that your son over there?

Mom
Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome.

Clerk
Tourette's Syndrome?

Mom
It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.

Clerk
Oh...

Boy
Shiit!  Dumb shiiit!

Mom
A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?

Thomas
All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!

Mom
Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. 

Cartman
Dude, that mom is kewl. 

Thomas
Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!

Cartman
Are you talkin' to me?!

Thomas
No. Cocknose!

Cartman
What's your problem, kid?!

Mom
Oh, a-I'm sorry.  My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. 

Cartman
What?

Thomas
Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!

Mom
People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.

Thomas
Asshole ASSHOLE.

Cartman
Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?

Thomas
Mom, can we just go home, please?

Mom
It's okay, Thomas. They understand.

Thomas
I want tuh go!  Shitfag!

Man 1
Poor kid.

Clerk
Yeah.

Cartman
All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?

Clerk
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.

Man 1
Yeah! 

Cartman
Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 

Clerk
Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?

Cartman
I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!

Liane
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.

Cartman
Puh- pussy!

Liane
Oh...

Cartman
Pussy! Cock! Shit! 

Liane
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called Tour, Tourette's Syndrome?

Cartman
Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 

Doctor
That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.

Cartman
...Cocksucker!

Doctor
...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.

Cartman
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!

Liane
Oh Doctor, can you help him?

Doctor
We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.

Cartman
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.

Doctor
Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.

Cartman
Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 

Cartman
Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!

Kyle
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 

Cartman
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!

Principal Victoria
Good morning, Eric. 

Kyle
Did Cartman just say shitballs to the principal?

Butters
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.

Kyle
What?

Craig
He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say shitballs to the principal I'd be sooo happy.

Cartman
Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.

Principal Victoria
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.

Kyle
He's faking.

Cartman
Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.

Kyle
You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!

Cartman
...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.

Kyle
Who cares about saying whatever you-?

Cartman
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.

Kyle
Grrhh, whatever. 

Cartman
Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 

Craig
If I could say asspussy to the counselor I would be sooo happy.

Mrs. Garrison
Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?

Cartman
Dicktits!

Mrs. Garrison
-when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?

Cartman
Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 

Mrs. Garrison
Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-

Cartman
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.

Mrs. Garrison
All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?  Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers

Cartman
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!

Kyle
Will you knock it off already?!

Cartman
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.

Kyle
Don't push me, asshole!

Mrs. Garrison
Kyle, watch your language! 

Craig
If I could yell tampon dickshit in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.

Mrs. Garrison
Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.

Principal Victoria
I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 

Mr. Donaldson
Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Ass. ASS.  I want to help your class better understand this illness.  Piss!

Kyle
No! Up yours, fatboy!

Cartman
Kyle please! I'm sorry!

Kyle
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!

Mr. Donaldson
Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?!

Kyle
N-no, I'm just saying that I think-

Mr. Donaldson
Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  Ass! ASS!  We aren't faking, young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass.  PISS! PIIISS!

Cartman
That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!

Mr. Donaldson
This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!

Principal Victoria
No.

Mr. Donaldson
This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this bully to see that Tourette's is very real.  Piiiss.

Mr. Donaldson
Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor.  ASS!  I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's

Teen Boy
Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze.  Brrrrr!  It isn't contagious like some people think.  Brrrrrrrrr!

Blonde Girl
A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic  is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. 

Thomas
Aw shit! COCK!

Brunette
Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I  Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.

Mr. Donaldson
You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!

Kyle
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.

Teen Boy
Fun?  Brrrrr!  This really isn't all that fun.  Brrr, brrrrrr!

Thomas
Aw shit!

Brunette
Boop. 

Mr. Donaldson
Piiiss, coming from my aaass!

Thomas
Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.

Kyle
Dude...

Mr. Donaldson
Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.

Kyle
Aw, come on!

Mr. Donaldson
So then you apologize for what you said before?

Kyle
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

Mr. Donaldson
Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities.  Piss! PISS!

Sheila
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.

Mr. Donaldson
Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. 

Gerald
Well Kyle?

Kyle
I'm sorry.

Cartman
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.

Kyle
I'm sorry.

Cartman
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?

Kyle
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 

Cartman
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!

Sheila
Oh, thank you Eric.

Cartman
Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 

Mr. Donaldson
Well I think we can all put this behind us now.  Piiiss out my aaass!

Cartman
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 

Announcer
Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.

Hansen
I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children.

Hansen
Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.

Predator
Oh God, Whoa no.

Hansen
What are you doin' here?

Predator
I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess.

Hansen
But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.

Cartman
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman

Hansen
This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado.

Announcer
Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.

Cartman
Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 

Cartman
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!

Kyle
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!

Cartman
Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.

Kyle
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!

Cartman
Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?

Kyle
...Scotch?

Cartman
Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.

Kyle
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!

Cartman
Then the game is on, Kyle.

Kyle
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 

Cartman
Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? Big titties! Buttmunch! There's no walls anymore! Shit! Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. I wet my bed last night. 

Kyle
What did you say?

Cartman
Uhh nuh-nothing...

Kyle
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 

Cartman
Hm. That was... weird.

Mr. Donaldson
We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome.  Piiiss out my aaass! 

Thomas
The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...  Cock!

Cartman
Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 

Craig
If I could say titty sprinkles on national television I would be sooo happy.

Cartman
And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?

Mr. Mackey
Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?

Cartman
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was asslicker cumballs. And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 

Patty
Eewwww!

Cartman
Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 

Butters
Uh hey Eric!

Cartman
Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?

Butters
Wuh who are you talking about?

Cartman
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 

Butters
You... you and your cousin touched wieners?

Cartman
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 

Cartman
Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!

Liane
Is there a problem, sweetie?

Cartman
No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.

Mr. Mackey
Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.

Cartman
Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 

Hansen
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen.

Cartman
Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.

Hansen
Why not?

Cartman
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.

Hansen
Why don't you have a seat?

Cartman
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.

Hansen
Go ahead and take a seat.

Cartman
But I'm not gonna do the-

Hansen
Take a seat, right over there.  What are you doing here?

Cartman
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?

Hansen
But you are doing the show.

Cartman
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.

Hansen
Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.

Cartman
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 

Hansen
Why don't you take a seat?

Cartman
Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!

Hansen
Have a seat.

Cartman
No, I'm just gonna go- 

Hansen
Take a seat, right over there.

Cartman
How does he do that?

Hansen
You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called To Catch A Predator. We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself.  It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you shot yourself. 

Announcer
Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline.

Hansen
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm  Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction.

A Page
Five minutes, kid.

Cartman
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like I touched penises with my cousin!  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.

Kyle
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?

Thomas
Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!

Kyle
You sure you don't wanna back out?

Thomas
Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!

Kyle
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like To Catch A Predator.  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 

HotForBoys219
Hi, are you CuteBilly182?

Thomas
Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!

HotForBoys219
Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?

Thomas
N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!

HotForBoys219
Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. 

Hansen
So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- 

HotForBoys219
Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house.

Hansen
What are you doing?!

HotForBoys219
Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!

Hansen
Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there.

HotForBoys219
Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! 

Hansen
Aw, not again.

Cartman
Kyle?

Kyle
Surprise, fatass!

Cartman
Kyle, what are you doing?

Kyle
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.

Pedo 2
Hey, I brought you some Wendy's.

Thomas
Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!

Pedo 2
Score! 

Pedo 2
Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! 

Audience Members
Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?

Hansen
What the hell is going on?!

Pedo 3
Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! 

Pedo 4
Chris Hansen! 

Pedo 5
Dateline?! 

Pedo 6
I knew it! 

Pedo 7
There aren't really brownies! 

Hansen
Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!

Thomas
Stupid shit! Cock! 

Hansen
What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there.

Thomas
Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!

Hansen
Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! 

Craig
Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.

Thomas
You would?

Craig
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?

Kyle
Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 

Cartman
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!

Kyle
What?

Cartman
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!

Kyle
No, I- I beat you!

Cartman
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 

Thomas, Kyle
Aww shit!

Dr. Doctor
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. 

Randy
Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!

Dr. Doctor
Well, what food have you been eating?

Randy
P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff.

Dr. Doctor
I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.

Randy
How painful is painful?

Randy
Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?

Sharon
What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!

Randy
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?

Sharon
Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!

Randy
Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 

Sharon
Randy!

Randy
Look what your old man made.

Stan
No way!

Randy
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?

Stan
No, never.

Shelly
Gross, Dad, sick! 

Sharon
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 

Randy
I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.

Sharon
Why?!

Randy
Well he's gotta see this.

Sharon
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-

Randy
No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!

Sharon
Oh, for the love of God, Randy! 

Randy
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 

Randy
Hey guys!

Gerald
Hey Randy.

Stephen
Oh, hey Randy.

Stuart
Are you feelin' better?

Randy
Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.

Jimbo
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.

Randy
Well I don't know about ever...

Randy
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.

Randy
I guess it was pretty big.

Stuart
A football? That's amazing.

Stephen
I've never heard of one that big.

Gerald
Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 

Randy
It wasn't bigger than mine was.

Gerald
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 

Randy
Mine... mine was bigger.

Gerald
I doubt it. 

Randy
You wanna see it?

Stuart
Oh my freaking Lord.

Skeeter
That did not seriously come out of your ass.

Randy
Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.

Gerald
Jesus...

Stan
That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?

Gerald
It's... other-worldly.

Stephen
Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!

Randy
That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 

Sharon
Randy Marsh!

Randy
Aw crap!

Sharon
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!

Randy
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.

Sharon
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!

Secretary
Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?  The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir.  Because we don't want to.  Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification.  You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.  You're welcome.  Jeez, another one.  Guinness World Records America.

Randy
Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 

Secretary
You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.

Chubby Official
Herr President, take a look at this.  It is a crap sent to us from the United States.

EFSM President
Very niiice.  Has it been checked for accuracy?

Chubby Official
It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!

EFSM President
We'd better get on a plane. Right away. 

EFSM President
Hm, enshnusen?

Chubby Official
Verron snusunarich.

EFSM President
What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?

Randy
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.

Chubby Official
I believe I detect some cabbage as well?

Randy
Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.

Sharon
You have got to be kidding me.

Randy
These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 

EFSM President
It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh.

Sharon
For the love of God!

EFSM President
Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics

Randy
Courics...

Chubby Official
The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.

EFSM President
The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.

Randy
But that means...

Third Official
That's right. You are the new world's champion!

Randy
Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 

EFSM President
Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.

M. C.
He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono! 

Bono
Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much.  Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award.  Yes?

EFSM President
Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.

Bono
What?! That's impossible! How big was it?

Senator
We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. 

Randy
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!

Senator
To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff. 

Broloff
Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-

Chubby Official
Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff! 

Broloff
Das shpoitenhoff?  Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!

People in Crowd
Oh! Bono? Cool!

Broloff
Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?

Bono
Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.

Crowd
Whoa!

Sharon
Bono?! 

Bono
As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. 

Broloff
You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono! 

Man
Bo-no! Woo-ooo!

Stan
Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.

Randy
I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!

Stan
Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.

Randy
You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.

Sharon
Come on guys, lasagna's ready.

Randy
Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!

Sharon
What are you talking about?

Randy
You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!

Sharon
Randy, this is ridiculous!

Randy
Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 

Sharon
Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!

Stan
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 

Sharon
Wha? Wha?

Jimbo
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?

Stuart
'Cause he's Bono, that's why.

Stephen
But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!

Randy
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.

Gerald
Oh yes there is! You could do it again!

Randy
What?

Gerald
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!

Stephen
Hey. Hey that's right.

Randy
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.

Skeeter
Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!

Stuart
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?

Randy
Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!

Stephen
Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!

Randy
I would need a lot of help.

Gerald
That's what we're here for.

Jimbo
Come on, Randy, what do you say?!

Randy
I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!

Anchorman
Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.

Sharon
Oh no.

Anchorman
But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?

Sharon
Agh!

Anchorman
Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. .

Female Anchor
Is this really newsworthy?

Anchorman
You just don't understand.

Female Anchor
You're right. I don't.

Anchorman
At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.

Bono
Hello, hello.

Broloff
Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.

Bono
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!

Broloff
Well he's going to try.

Bono
Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.

Broloff
Bono, we've never had that rule before.

Bono
I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!

Assistant
Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. 

Randy
Oooooo.

Assistant
Okay, take a deep breath.  I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics.

Jimbo
Fourteen?! 

Stephen
That's great, Randy!

Randy
Can I, can I see it?

Assistant
Sure. This is your colon, a-and here...  is the feces growing inside your belly. 

Randy
Ahhh...

Gerald
Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.

Randy
In Zurich?

Gerald
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.

Assistant
I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.

Stan
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?

Butler
Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! 

Bono
Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. 

Stan
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.

Bono
Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?

Stan
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?

Bono
Let him have it? Why would I do that?!

Stan
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.

Bono
I have the first-place trophy for that.

Stan
Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?

Bono
I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.

Stan
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.

Bono
Number two?! NUMBER TWO?! 

Stan
Agh!

Bono
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!

Stan
I take it back!

Bono
Say I'm not number two!

Stan
You're not number two!

Bono
That's right! I'm not! 

Stan
What is wrong with that guy?

Butler
Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! 

Chubby Official
It must be quite a crap.

Jimbo
Come on, Randy. You have to push! 

Stan
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!

Butler
Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!

Stan
So Bono's newest record is a lie!

Butler
Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.

Stan
So?

Butler
So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...

Stan
He's the record.

Butler
Yes.

Randy
I can't do it! I can't do it!

Assistant
The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!

Randy
But then, does it still count?

Bono
Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!

Broloff
I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.

Randy
No... Nooo...

Jimbo
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.

Randy
I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 

Sharon
What?!

Randy
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.

Broloff
Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.

Bono
I had a feeling it would be.

Stan
Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.

Bono
Get him out of here!

Third Official
What are you talking about, young man?

Stan
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!

Bono
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!

Broloff
It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.

Chubby Official
Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?

Broloff
It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.

Bono
Poppa no! Say nothing more!

Broloff
Come to me my... darling precious child.  After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.

Bono
No Poppa... No Poppa...

Broloff
There there, my little crap.  Don't cry.  Here, do you want the biddy? Hm?  Does Bono want the biddy?  Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?

Stan
Dude.

Broloff
I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time.  Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.

Bono
Biddy. 

Broloff
My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.

Stan
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.

Chubby Official
You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.

Broloff
Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!

Randy
Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 

Third Official
My God...

Chubby Official
It must be over a hundred Courics!

Stan
Dad, are you all right?

Randy
Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.

Chubby Official
Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. 

Cartman
All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 

Kyle
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.

Cartman
It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?

Clyde
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 

Cartman
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 

Kyle
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!

Cartman
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?

Token
... I don't want the code name Blackie.

Cartman
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 

Kyle
This is fucking retarded!

Cartman
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 

Kyle
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!

Cartman
Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!

Butters
This is faggot. Go ahead.

Cartman
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.

Butters
Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.

Kyle
Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!

Cartman
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!

Kyle
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!

Butters
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!

Cartman
Set off diversion track C! 

Stan
Dude...

Jimmy
Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.

Cartman
Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 

Butters
Wow.

Stan
Cool.

Craig
No way.

Token
Whoa.

Jason
Wow.

Cartman
Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!

Leprechaun
You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!

Cartman
Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 

Stan
Where'd he go? 

Leprechaun
I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! 

Craig
Dude.

Cartman
Kyle, suck my balls. 

Kyle
Dad, where do leprechauns come from?

Gerald
From Ireland.

Kyle
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.

Sheila
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.

Kyle
I thought I did. 

Cartman
Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?

Sheila
Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here.

Cartman
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.

Kyle
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!

Cartman
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.

Kyle
I'm not doing it, fatass!

Gerald
Doing what?

Cartman
We had a deal, Kyle!

Kyle
Just get out of here!

Cartman
You signed an agreement, Kyle!!

Kyle
I don't care if I signed an agreement!

Gerald
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.

Cartman
Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.

Gerald
What was the agreement?

Kyle
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.

Sheila
Whatwhatwhat?!

Cartman
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!

Kyle
Hey dudes. 

Jimmy
Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?

Kyle
How was what?

Jimmy
Sucking Cartman's b-balls.

Kyle
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!

Stan
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.

Kyle
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.

Fanciful Mayor
Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?

Stan
...What do you know about the leprechaun?

Fanciful Mayor
Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?

Kyle
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!

Fanciful Mayor
Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate?  And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little...  imagination.

Stan
Who the hell are you?

Fanciful Mayor
Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine? 

Kyle
Dude.

Fanciful Mayor
Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.

Butters
Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?

Fanciful Mayor
Ubeuh... uh... n... no?

Butters
Ah, all right then.

Stan
Come on, guys. 

Butters
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.

Fanciful Mayor
All aboard the Imagination Balloon! 
Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
.

Kyle
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!

Fanciful Mayor
Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here.

The Boys
Whoa...

Stan
What is this place?

Fanciful Mayor
This... is Imaginationland.  It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together.  Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond! 

Cheetara
Hello. 

Lollipop King
Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King.

Mr. Tumnus
We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom.

Fanciful Mayor
Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun! 

Pat the Hammer
What did he tell you? Did he have any news?

Stan
Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-

A Terrorist
ALLAH!!! 

Fanciful Mayor
OH FUCK NO! 

Charlie Brown
Awwwgh! 

Cheetara
AAAAAH!

Kyle
STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 

Draco
Quickly boys! Get on my back! 

Butters
Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!

Stan
Butters.

Butters
Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 

Kyle
Dude! 

Butters
Hey guys!

The Boys
Goodbye Butters.

Kyle
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 

Stan
Hello?

Kyle
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.

Stan
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?

Kyle
...And then it got attacked by terrorists?

Stan
Yeah! How'd you know?

Kyle
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!

Sharon
Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 

Stan
Why?

Linda
Our darling Butters never came home last night.

Kyle
What did they say??

Steven
We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.

Kyle
...Dude...

General
Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. 

Man 1
Our imagination?

Woman 1
How?

Specialist
The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable.

General
We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public. 

Fanciful Mayor
No! It's just a Care Bear! 

Man 2
Oh my God.

General
Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.

Butters
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 

General
Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.

Cartman
I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!

Judge
Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?

Kyle
I...

Judge
Is this not your signature on the contract?

Kyle
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?

Judge
From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.

Cartman
Yesss!

Judge
You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case! 

Cartman
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.

General
What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.

Specialist
In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't.

General
That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?

M. Night Shyalaman
What if...  What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future?

General
N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.

M. Night Shyalaman
But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group being terrorized? By aliens?

General
No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.

M. Night Shyalaman
How about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead.

General
Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?

Michael Bay
I believe I can.  We start... by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH!  and it, and it's all like CRAAWWWLL  a-and motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters, right? 

General
No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!

Michael Bay
An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH  And then this huuuge tanker full of dyna- 

General
Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!

Michael Bay
I... don't understand the difference.

General
I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.

Mel Gibson
Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them!

General
Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?

Mel Gibson
How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland! Ohhh!

Specialist
Heyy... that's not a bad idea.

General
Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!

Mel Gibson
Oogh! Yess! 

Specialist
All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here.  Nothing in American folklore or storytelling match this kid. He appears to be... just some kid. 

General
I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!

Specialist
Yes sir! 

General
Who are you?...

Butters
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.

Pat the Hammer
Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?

Fanciful Mayor
They're going something to Rockety Rocket.

Rockety Rocket
No! Leave me alone! Haaa!

Cinderella
It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety?

Fanciful Mayor
The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!

Butters
Uh what's the Barrier?

Fanciful Mayor
The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side! 

Rockety Rocket
No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?! 

Cinderella
We can't let this happen.

Suitcase
It will be the end of Imaginationland.

Pat the Hammer
Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.

Butters
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?

Fanciful Mayor
Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!

Butters
Waaahaa!

Cartman
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.

Craig
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.

Cartman
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.

Clyde
Hey, he's here. 

Cartman
What? Move aside, move aside! 

Stan
Dude, do you really have to do it?

Kyle
Let's just get this over with!

Cartman
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.

Kyle
God damnit!

Cartman
Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 

Specialist
That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.

General
You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.

Kyle
Who are you?

General
There's no time! You need to come with us right now! 

Cartman
Hey, let go of him! 

General
We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.

Cartman
No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 

Rockety Rocket
No! Noooo! 

Butters
Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.

Terrorists
ALLAH!! 

Rockety Rocket
AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!! 

Fanciful Mayor
That was your plan to stop them??

Butters
Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?

Fanciful Mayor
That's fucking stupid!  They are coming... 

Driver
Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'

Cartman
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.

Driver
You goin' to Washington to visit family?

Cartman
I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 

Cartman
Previously on Battlestar Galactica 

Stan
What is this place?

Fanciful Mayor
This... is Imaginationland.

A Terrorist
ALLAH!!! 

Kyle
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!

Butters
Hold on, fellas!

The Boys
Butters.

General
Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.

Fanciful Mayor
If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!

Terrorists
ALLAH!! 

Rockety Rocket
No!! 

Steven
Butters, time for breakfast.

Butters
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.

Steven
Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.

Butters
Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.

Steven
You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.

Butters
Huh?

Fanciful Mayor
Hey, wake up, stupid!  Come on, wake up, kid!

Butters
No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!

Fanciful Mayor
NO! You passed out and peed your pants!

Cinderella
Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! 

Butters
Oh hamburgers! 

Fanciful Mayor
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! 

Butters
WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 

Stan
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.

General
What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!

Kyle
We just... went on a balloon ride.

Specialist
There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.

Stan
Dude, we don't remember.

General
Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!

Specialist
It was the Chinese, wasn't it?

Kyle
...What?

Specialist
We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination.  Is that where you were?!

Stan
No.

General
That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?

Specialist
It is better than ours?

Stan
Your what?

Specialist
Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-

General
Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.

Tom
Ohh, I'm sorry sir.

Kyle
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?

General
Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!

Tom
Yes sir.  We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-

General
THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!

Tom
Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.

Stan
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?

General
All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.

Cartman
Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. Time to pay up, Kyle.  But then...  NO! NOOO!  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 

Elderly woman
You okay, kid?

Cartman
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.

General
Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called Project Imagination Doorway.

Stan
That's not very imaginative.

General
According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.

Lead tech
But we're close, sir. We're real close.

General
They've been saying that for over forty years.

Lead tech
You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.

Kyle
Ah I guess.

Lead tech
What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.

Kyle
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.

General
Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.

Lead tech
What song?

Stan
The Imagination song?

Lead tech
That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!

General
Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?

Stan, Kyle
Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation

Operator
Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.

Lead tech
Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?

Stan, Kyle
Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-

Kyle
No, no dude, it went up there.

Stan
Imagina-he-hey-

Kyle
Imagina-eh

Stan
Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.

General
I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! 

Lollipop King
Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?

Butters
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.

Fanciful Mayor
Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.

Butters
Really?

Fanciful Mayor
NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke! 

Snarf
Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?

Fanciful Mayor
Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!

Lollipop King
Castle Sunshine?

Fanciful Mayor
Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain! 

Orc
We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!

The Minotaur
Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.

Freddy Krueger
Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!

The Minotaur
Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!

ManBearPig
Nonsense!  Your evil is stale!

Headless Horseman
I am the most evil imaginary character! 

Squirrelly Squirrel
Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side. 

Critter
Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.

Woodland Critters
Yaaaay!

The Minotaur
What evil imaginary characters are they?

Creature from the Black Lagoon
They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..

Squirrelly Squirrel
Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.

Rabbity Rabbit
And eat their flesh!

Beavery Beaver
B'hut first we should rape them!

Beary Bear
How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?

Squirrelly Squirrel
Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear. 

Jason Voorhees
Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.

Cartman
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!

Secretary
I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.

Cartman
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!

Secretary
There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.

Tom
Let me handle this!  I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway!  Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.

Stan, Kyle
Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-

Stan
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.

Kyle
Right, then it was Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on 

Lead tech
It's open! It's open!

Operator
Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! 

General
All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!

Butters
How much further to Castle Sunshine?

Snarf
Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. 

Butters
What was that?

Lollipop King
Over here.  Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake. 

Strawberry Shortcake
Please, let me go.  Wuh.  Wuh!  Dugh! 

Snarf
Oh my God! Snarf. 

Strawberry Shortcake
Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!

The Minotaur
Now kill her!

Squirrelly Squirrel
Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough.

Freddy Krueger
What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.

Jason Voorhees
Yeah, that's super hardcore.

Squirrelly Squirrel
Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.

Beavery Beaver
Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!

Deery Deer
Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.

Beary Bear
How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike? 

The Minotaur
Nobody here has AIDS!

Woodland Critters
Awwww!!

Beary Bear
But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!

Squirrelly Squirrel
Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest. 

Lollipop King
Dude, run, run, ruuun! 

General
All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?

Soldiers
Yes sir!

General
Are you ready, Kurt Russell?

Kurt Russell
I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.

General
Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!

Tech 1
Sir, we have a security breach!

General
What?!

Tech 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!

General
Sector Two?? 

Kyle
Cartman??

Cartman
Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!

General
Who the hell are you?!

Cartman
That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!

General
Get him out of here!

Cartman
No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!

General
Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?

Kyle
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!

General
All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.

Kyle
Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!

General
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.

Kyle
Stan?

Stan
Dude, you did make a deal... 

Cartman
Theee conference room is which way? 

Cartman
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.

Kyle
I didn't bail, I got picked up by the government!

Cartman
Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.

Kyle
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-

Cartman
Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.

Kyle
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!

Cartman
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 

Kyle
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 

Cartman
Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...

Kyle
Just get to it already!

Lead tech
Entering the portal in five seconds.

General
Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?

Kurt Russell
Check 1, 2.

General
Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?

Kurt Russell
We're here. We're s-somewhere.

Tech 3
They are inside the imagination, sir.

General
What do you see in there?

Kurt Russell
There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and-  It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel.  Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks.

Lead tech
Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.

Techs
Awww.

General
Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.

Kurt Russell
Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.

Stan
Wait, woodland critters... 

Kurt Russell
There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.

Stan
Get them out of there!

General
What?

Stan
Tell them to get away now!

General
What's the matter?

Kurt Russell
Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!

General
Kurt Russell, what's going on?!

Kurt Russell
They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!

General
Get out of there, Kurt Russell!

Kurt Russell
They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!

Cartman
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?

Kyle
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!

Cartman
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?

Kyle
Let's just DO IT! 

Cartman
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 

Guard
Everyone to the main hall now! Go!

Cartman
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.

Guard
Everyone to the main hall NOW! 

Cartman
No! Goddammit no!

Snarf
Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.

Butters
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?

Lollipop King
Wait! There it is. We made it!  Castle Sunshine!  Hurry! Get inside! 

Perseus
The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! 

Butters
Wait! Waaait! 

Perseus
What imaginary character are you?!

Lollipop King
The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?

Snarf
And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.

Perseus
And what imaginary character are you?

Butters
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.

Perseus
What's a Butters?

Snarf
The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.

Perseus
So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!

Butters
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-

Perseus
You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!

Snarf
Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!

General
Talk to me! What's going on?! 

Lead tech
Something is... coming through the gate from the other side. 

Operator
What is it?!

Tech 4
Its like a... half man half bear!

Lead tech
And half pig! 

Tech 5
Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig! 

General
Look out! 

Lead tech
No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear! 

General
Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!

Kyle
AAAHHH! 

Stan
KYLE!! 

Kyle
AAAAAAAAAAAA- 

Butters
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!

Perseus
That is for the Council of Nine to decide!

Lollipop King
Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland

Aslan
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.

Zeus
Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!

Aslan
And what say you, Morpheus?

Morpheus
How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.

Glinda
Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.

Jesus
No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.

Luke Skywalker
I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just us go.  That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice! 

Perseus
Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.

Aslan
Bring him here!

Paramedic
Clear!  I'm sorry. He's gone.

Cartman
No! Kyle can't die. 

Paramedic
I'm sorry, young man.

Cartman
Kyle?

Paramedic
Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.

Cartman
NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!

General
He's gone, little boy.

Cartman
Zap him again!  Do it!

Paramedic
Charging.

Cartman
DO IT!  Come on buddy.

Paramedic
Clear.

Cartman
Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 

Aslan
I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.

Zeus
What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?

Morpheus
Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.

Butters
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.

Luke Skywalker
If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.

Butters
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...

Aslan
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.

Tom
Sir? Are you sure about this?

General
We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination. 

Cartman
Wake up, Kyle. 

Aslan
Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked.  And so many of us were killed.  The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed.  Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. 

Beavery Beaver
This is gonna be fun, huh? 

Aslan
We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle.

Butters
Wuh, what can I do?

Aslan
You have a power here that you have yet to understand.

Al Gore
Back it up!  Look!  Right there!  See that?!  What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig!  I told you it was real!  Look again!  There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!

Official 1
Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.

Al Gore
Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! 

Doctor
He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.

Stan
Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 

Kyle
Stan? 

Stan
Hello?

Kyle
Stan?

Cartman
Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?

Kyle
Cartman, what's happened?

Cartman
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.

Kyle
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!

Cartman
You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see

Kyle
Arh!

Cartman
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!

Kyle
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!

Cartman
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?

Kyle
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?

Cartman
Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 

Jesus
Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!

Aslan
Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!

Butters
What powers? Ah I don't understand.

Gandalf
You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.

Butters
I c-I can?

Aslan
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.

Butters
How?

Glinda
You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.

Butters
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!

Luke Skywalker
Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.

Gandalf
Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be. 

Steven
Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!

Butters
AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 

Aslan
What are you doing?! We need Santa!

Butters
I'm trying!

Wonder Woman
Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!

Zeus
You must believe in Santa!

Aslan
BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!

Butters
GAA HAA!

Cartman
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split

Kyle
Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.

Anchorman
A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination.  Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on.

General
We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.

Reporter 1
Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!

General
By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.

Reporter 2
Is nuking our imagination really prudent?

Reporter 3
Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?

Reporter 4
Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-

General
We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!

Reporter 5
...A-ooch

Anchorman
The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.

Hippie 1
That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!

Hippie 2
Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!

Anchorman
Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?

Mike
Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.

Anchorman
Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.

Mike
That's right, Steven, yeah.

Kyle
Oh for the love of God!

Stan
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

Kyle
Stan! Dude, is that you?

Stan
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.

Kyle
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.

Stan
...Oh that makes sense.

Kyle
Dude, what's happening?

Stan
I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.

Lollipop King
The evil characters are here. 

Jesus
There are so many of them. HAAAAA! 

Aslan
There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!

Butters
Santa. Saaanta.

Luke Skywalker
Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.

Butters
Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 

Cartman
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?

Anchorman
A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!

Chief Justice
The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them.

General
Thank you.

Kyle
Oh no.

Chief Justice
This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.

Cartman
...What?

Steven
So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway.

Stan
Kyle? What's happening?

Kyle
The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.

Stan
What?! You can't let them do that!

Kyle
What am I supposed to do?

Stan
Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!

Kyle
Stan? Stan?? 

Cartman
Where are you going?!

Kyle
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!

Cartman
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.

Kyle
No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 

Cartman
We had a DEAL KYLE!

Kyle
Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!

Cartman
IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!

Morpheus
I need more spinach for Popeye! 

Tron Soldier
I-ee got one. I got him. 

Beary Bear
Hey there. 

Icarus
We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!

Aslan
Then the day is lost.

Wonder Woman
Wait! Aslan, look! 

Santa
What? What happened?

Luke Skywalker
You did it, kid!

Aslan
Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!

Santa
Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa! 

Aslan
Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!

Guard 2
This area is restricted, little boy.

Kyle
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.

Guard 2
Get behind the line with the other protesters! 

Hippie 3
No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! 

Kyle
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!

Guard 2
You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!

Hippie 4
Stop that nuke!

Hippies
Stop that nuke!

Hippies and Kyle
Stop that nuke! 

Al Gore
What's going on here?  The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. 

Aslan
Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!

Butters
Huwhoa! 

Perseus
Aslan! We're losing the battle!

Robin Hood
We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps.

Aslan
Cavity Creeps?

Cavity Creeps
We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!

Wonder Woman
What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?

Perseus
Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.

Aslan
Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! 

Robin Hood
Yes!

Gandalf
His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.

Archangel
Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! 

Butters
Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!

Stan
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.

Aslan
Project Imagination Doorway? 

Gandalf
Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.

Stan
No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.

Luke Skywalker
What?

Butters
Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?

Stan
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.

Aslan
We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!

Stan
The Chosen One?

Butters
Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.

Computer
Missile launch sequence initiated.

General
All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.

Tech 1
Sir, we have a security breach!

General
What?!

Tech 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!

General
Sector 2? 

Cartman
What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!

General
What?

Cartman
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?

Lab Tech
Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.

Tom
Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.

Tech 1
Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.

Tom
Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!

Tech 7
It's possible that hell is also imaginary.

Tech 2
Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?

Personnel
Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.

Lab Tech
What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.

Tech 3
Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.

Lab Tech 2
So it'd be all right.

Cartman
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?

Tom
Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!

Tech 3
Well then, what about Buddha?

Tom
Well of course he's imaginary!

Lab Tech 3
Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.

Tech 7
Am I real?

General
All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!

Cartman
No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!

Stan
Kyle? Kyle, what happened?

Kyle
Nothing.

Stan
What??

Kyle
Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 

Stan
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!

Kyle
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!

Stan
Well you have to convince them they are real!

Kyle
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls

Stan
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.

Kyle
Huh? 

Jesus
Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.

Kyle
Oh boy...

Jesus
What seems to be the problem, my child?

Kyle
Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?

Luke Skywalker
No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.

Kyle
Aah.

Luke Skywalker
Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?

Kyle
Yeah, I guess.

Luke Skywalker
Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something. 

Superman
Kyle, this is Superman.

Kyle
Hi Superman.

Superman
I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.

Kyle
I know.

Superman
You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.

Kyle
Oh God...

Superman
Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.

Jesus
Popeye, I need some help here! 

Lollipop King
Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters. 

Popeye
Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!

Beary Bear
Hey, what is that?

Butters
More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!

Jesus
All right!

Aslan
The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!

Computer
Missile launch in one minute.

Cartman
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!

General
Prepare for launch...

Tech 1
Sir, we have a security breach!

General
What?!

Tech 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!

General
Sector 2? 

Cartman
Kyle?

General
The hell are you doing back here?!

Kyle
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.

General
Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!

Kyle
You have to stop!

General
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?

Kyle
Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of real. They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 

General
Abort the sequence. 

Cartman
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 

Kyle
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!

Al Gore
What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!

General
There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.

Al Gore
No! ManBearPig has to die! 

Tech 3
Oh Jesus no! 

Lollipop King
That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!

Aslan
The day is ours! 

Stan
Kyle!

Butters
Fellas! Where'd you come from? 

Zeus
What is that? 

Butters
Huh... 

Jesus
He did it!

Fanciful Mayor
Oh look, I'm back!

Luke Skywalker
Nice going, kid. 

Fanciful Mayor
The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.

Stan
Dude! How did you do that, Butters?

Butters
Well I just... used my imagination.

All
Awwww 

Cartman
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 

Kyle
Cartman, don't!

Cartman
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 

Stan
Dude.

Lollipop King
Oh my God.

Cartman
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?

Kyle
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!

Cartman
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.

General
That's true. You did.

Cartman
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 

Santa
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.

Kyle
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!

Fanciful Mayor
Whatever you imagine to be real, is real. 

Steven
Butters?  Butters!

Butters
A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.

Steven
Come on, Butters, time to get up. 

Butters
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!

Steven
You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!

Linda
You are grounded, mister!

Butters
Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.

Steven
Oh yes you are!

Butters
Oh yeah? 

Steven
That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! 

Butters
Ahhh shit.

Cartman
Stan, you guys are good! 

Randy
Sharon, what are the boys doing?

Sharon
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.

Randy
They can play guitar now?

Sharon
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.

Randy
Ohhh.

Sharon
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.

Randy
Hey yeah...

Stan
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 

Randy
So you boys like this music, huh?

Kyle
Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.

Butters
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.

Randy
Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-

Stan
Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!

Randy
I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?

Cartman
Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.

Stan
Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.

Randy
But... But this is real.

Cartman
Real guitars are for old people.

Craig
Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 

Stan
Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 

M.C.
Are you ready to rock? 

Kansas
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

M.C.
Game over! You suck! 

Butters
They're gonna do it!

Cartman
Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!

Kyle
Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 

M.C
You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!

Stan
Dude, we are total rock stars now!

Randy
You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 

Stan
Hang on.

Man
Stan Marsh?

Stan
Yeah?

Man
I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Stan
Yeah, we did. 

Mr. Kincade
I'm impressed.  And I'd like to be your manager.

Stan
Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!

Randy
No way!

Kyle
For reals? 

Mr. Kincade
Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.

Stan
That'd be awesome!

Mr. Kincade
So, we're in business then? 

Mr. Kincade
Well, what do you think?

Producer
I like it. That's these boys playing?

Mr. Kincade
No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.

Producer
That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 

Mr. Kincade
Yes! You did it, boys.

Producer
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?

Stan, Kyle
Cool! 

Stan
Wow, this is a huge party.

Producer
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.

Stan
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 

Kyle
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 

Producer
Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.

Stan
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!

Kyle
Oh my God!

Producer
Would you boys like to meet him?

Stan
Are you serious??

Producer
Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.

Jay
Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.

Stan
Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.

Jay
Thanks...

Guest
Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?

Producer
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?

Kyle
Do we? He's a legend!

Producer
You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.

Tom Shane
That, would be impressive.

Kyle
Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.

Stan
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.

M.C.
You Rock!

Mr. Kincade
All right, nice rehearsal, boys.

Kyle
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?

Stan
Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.

Mr. Kincade
That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. 

Kyle
Oh, okay. Cool. 

Mr. Kincade
You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.

Stan
Really? That'd be sweet.

Mr. Kincade
I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.

Stan
What, you mean, Kyle?

Mr. Kincade
Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.

Stan
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.

Mr. Kincade
Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd.  I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.

Mr. Kincade
You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course.  Ah, Thad!  Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.

Thad
Sup? 

Mr. Kincade
That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? 

Thad
Yup.

Mr. Kincade
He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.

Stan
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?

Mr. Kincade
Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.  Check this out.  Pretty damn good, huh?

Stan
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play John the Fisherman? 

Mr. Kincade
Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.

Male Diner
Ohoh, I love this song. 

Butters
Wow wee, look at him go!

Kyle
Hey dude, how'd it-? 

Stan
...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.

Butters
Uh ohhh.

Kyle
Who is this?

Stan
This is um, Thad Jarvis.

Thad
Sup?

Kyle
Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?

Stan
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.

Kyle
But it's our game. We bought it together.

Stan
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.

Kyle
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!

Stan
Don't put this all on me, Kyle!

Cartman
Oh my God this is so awesome.

Stan
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-

Kyle
I have been sick!

Stan
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!

Kyle
I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 

Craig
Dude, this game rules.

Stan
Let's just do this, all right? 

Brett
Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?

Stan
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.

Brett
Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.

Stan
Huh?

Brett
Have you ever heard of...  Heroin Hero?

Stan
Hero-Heroin Hero?

Brett
Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.

Stan
And there's no score? No crowds?

Brett
No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.

The Dragon
Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.

Stan
Dude, this is awesome.

Producer
How are they coming?

Mr. Kincade
No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days

Mr. Hart
They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. 

Stan
Ugh. Damint.

Thad
Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?

Stan
Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!

Mr. Kincade
Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.

Stan
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!

Thad
No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.

Stan
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!

Mr. Kincade
Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?

Stan
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!

Thad
Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite.  I quit I quit I quit.  I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.

Stan
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!

Mr. Kincade
Stan, what is the matter with you?

Stan
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 

Mr. Kincade
What is this?

Stan
Man...

Mr. Kincade
Are you playing Heroin Hero?

Stan
Just, just a little.

Mr. Kincade
No!  Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!

Stan
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!

Mr. Kincade
You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!

Stan
No problem.

Older Boy
Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!

Kyle
I'm not done yet.

Younger Boy
Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?

Kyle
No. You're thinking of somebody else.

Younger Boy
Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points.

Older Boy
How come you're playing here now?

Kyle
Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?

Mick
You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.

Kyle
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.

Mick
Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.

Kyle
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.

Mick
Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.

Kyle
Thanks, Mick.

The Dragon
Catch me. Come on, catch me.  What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. 

Mr. Kincade
Marsh? Stan, you got-  Oh my God!  Get up, Stan! Wake up!

Stan
Huh? What, uh?

Mr. Kincade
You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!

Stan
The dragon. Where did it go?

Mr. Kincade
You've gotta pull it together!  Pull it together, Goddammit!

Mr. Kincade
Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. 

Token
Go Stan!

Cartman
All right, Stan, you've got it, man!

Token
Yeah, Stan!

Craig
Dude, what's the matter with him?

Butters
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!

Mr. Kincade
Goddamnit, he's a mess! 

Craig
Oh man, I can't watch this.

Mr. Kincade
What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! 

Cartman
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 

Mr. Hart
The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. 

Mr. Kincade
You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! 

Brett
There he is! So, did you break a million yet?

Stan
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!

Brett
Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.

Stan
I just wanna find something else to play.

Brett
Have you played...  Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.

Stan
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?

Brett
Sssure kid. Sure. 

Radio Host
All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero.  Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore.

Skid Row
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

Stan
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?

Kyle
What are you doing here? 

Stan
Please, ih ih, it won't take long.

Kyle
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 

Stan
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 

Kyle
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 

Stan
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.

Kyle
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 

Stan
That isn't it at all. 

Kyle
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 

Stan
I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.

Kyle
It was pretty fun, wasn't it?

Stan
Yeah.

Kyle
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.

Stan
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.

Kyle
I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!

Stan
What, you mean it?

Kyle
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.

Stan
Then let's go, dude! 

Kyle
Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?

Mick
Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?

Kyle
Thanks, Mick! 

Stan
All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 

Randy
Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.

The Dragon
Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.

Stan
Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!

Randy
Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.

The Dragon
Hehe, you almost caught me.

Stan
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!

Randy
I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?

Stan
You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 

Randy
NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!

Stan
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?

Cartman
Stop cheating, Craig! 

Craig
How was that cheating!

Cartman
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!

Butters
Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!

Cartman
What?

Butters
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 

The Boys
Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!

Butters
They're gonna do it! 

Craig
They did it!

Jimmy
Oh my sweet J-Jesus!

M.C.
You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. 

Stan
That's it?

Kyle
Goddammit! God dammit! 

Cartman
Butters, you wanna play me next? 

Butters
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 

Butters
Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!

Stan
Dude, Butters, calm down.

Butters
Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.

Craig
So who do they say is the cutest?

Butters
I donno.

Token
Who do they say is the ugliest?

Butters
I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 

Cartman
They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?

Stan
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?

Clyde
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.

Kyle
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.

Cartman
Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.

Craig
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!

Cartman
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!

Craig
You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?

Cartman
No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor

Kenny
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)

Cartman
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.

Butters
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.

Kyle
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 

Cartman
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.

Bebe
What??

Cartman
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!

Bebe
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!

Cartman
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.

Bebe
I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 

Cartman
Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!

Butters
Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.

Cartman
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.

Cartman
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail 

Butters
Neato!

Cartman
At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.

Butters
O-kay!

Cartman
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?

Nelly
Ow! What'dja do that for?!  Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! 

Cartman
Bail, bail! 

Cartman
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.

Butters
They sure don't.

Cartman
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time. When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.

Butters
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?

Cartman
Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 

Cartman
We got it! We got it! 

Craig
We got the list from the girls! 

Nelly
Give that back you dirty buttholes! 

Cartman
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 

Clyde
All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!

A Boy
Hurry hurry!

Craig
Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?

Clyde
What number am I on?

A Boy
Is it set up?

Stan
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.

Clyde
Me?  I'm the cutest? 

Stan
And then Token, and then me.

Token
I'm number two? Wow.

Butters
Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 

Craig
Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! 

Cartman
What?! That's bullcrap! 

Kenny
(Woohoo!) 

Kyle
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?

Cartman
You're last, dude! 

Kyle
No way.

Cartman
Yes way! Check it out! 

Stan
Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.

Cartman
So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!

Kyle
I'm last? Last?

Stan
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?

Kyle
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?

Stan
Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 

Butters
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!

Steven
Well good for you, Butters.

Linda
Way to go, champ.

Butters
Whoopie! 

Steven
Well, guess we don't have to ground him.

Sheila
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.

Kyle
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.

Sheila
Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!

Kyle
Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.

Sheila
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 

Kyle
Oh God! I do?

Gerald
But he has his mother's nose.

Kyle
Ahahah!

Sheila
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.

Kyle
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!

Sheila
Kyle, come back here! 

Cartman
I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!

Kyle
Hrrgh! 

Cartman
Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?

Martha
Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. 

Clyde
Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.

Clyde
Hey, what's goin' on?

Two Girls
Hey Clyde.

Clyde
Hey.

Anne
Hi Clyde.

Clyde
What's goin' on? 

Butters
Hey ugly! 

Clyde
Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 

Girl
Oh, not much, just hanging around-

Butters
Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 

Clyde
Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 

Cartman
Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 

Blonde Boy
Hey.

Kyle
Hello. 

Bushy Eyebrows Boy
Are you going to eat your pickle? 

Craig
Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 

Big-Eared Boy
I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.

Kyle
Yeah.

Big-Eared Boy
Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!

Kyle
No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!

Fat Girl
We're not?

Kyle
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.

Bushy Eyebrows Boy
Hey yeah.

Kyle
Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 

Lola
I know, that song is so awesome. 

Stan
Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?

Wendy
Of course, Stan. 

Stan
Just for a minute. Over here. 

Lola
You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?

Wendy
This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.

Stan
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.

Wendy
Which one? We make lists all the time.

Stan
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?

Wendy
Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-

Stan
So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.

Wendy
Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!

Stan
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?

Wendy
All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.

Bebe
Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.

Rebecca
If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?

Bebe
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?

Girls
Sunshine.

Lola
Deliberating Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse? Millie has the floor.

Millie
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that  Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's.

Blond Girl
I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.

Bebe
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.

Lola
Sunshine sparkle Wendy has the floor.

Wendy
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.

Girls
What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!

Heidi
Is she crazy?

Bebe
All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 

Wendy
Go ahead.

Stan
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?

Rebecca
You thought you should be number one?

Stan
NO.

Bebe
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!

Wendy
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.

Bebe
I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?

Girls
Sunshine.

Kyle
They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.

A Voice
Do not burn down the school, Kyle. 

Kyle
Who said that?

A Voice
I did.  Do you know who I am?

Kyle
Abraham Lincoln?

Abraham Lincoln
I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see.  I want you to look in here.  This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot.  This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal.  Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde.  Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special.

Clyde
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.

Abraham Lincoln
Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.

Kyle
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.

Abraham Lincoln
You must be patient.

Kyle
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!

Abraham Lincoln
Very well.

Abraham Lincoln
Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.

Kyle
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!

Abraham Lincoln
Well then you're just a fucking asshole! 

Wendy
Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.

Stan
I have no idea what you're talking about.

Wendy
It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 

Rebecca
Oh, hey Wendy.

Wendy
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?

Rebecca
Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.

Wendy
I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-

Rebecca
All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy!  You might not like... what you find!  Just back off and stop asking questions!  You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! 

Stan
That didn't sparkle with her, did it?

Clerk
One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?

Kyle
That should just about do it.

Jerry
Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?

Wendy
Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.

Lola
Why would she do that?

Wendy
Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 

Jenny
You just couldn't let it go! 

Wendy
Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.

Jenny
I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! 

Lola
Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father own the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.

Wendy
You knew!

Lola
Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!

Wendy
So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!

Jenny
Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!

Wendy
No. Not Bebe.

Jenny
She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.

Stan
What's going on?

Wendy
When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-

Jenny
Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simple generate a new list! Biggest Liars! And put you at the top!

Lola
Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!

Wendy
I don't think so! 

Lola
AAGH!

Wendy
Stan, run!

Stan
Jesus, dude! 

Stan
Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.

Yamal
He's burning down the school.

Wendy
What?

Yamal
He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.

Kyle
All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!

Stan
Kyle! Kyle, don't!

Kyle
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!

Stan
The list was a forgery, Kyle!

Kyle
Huh??

Stan
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 

A Girl
That's about far enough!  Give me that list, Wendy!

Kyle
Stan, what is going on?!

Stan
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.

Bebe
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!

Kyle
So what number was I??

Wendy
You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!

Bebe
Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!

Wendy
It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.

Bebe
Right?

Wendy
Is that a lace across the top?

Bebe
No, it's a little strap.

Stan
Wendy!

Wendy
Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!

Bebe
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 

Kyle
She's gonna kill us?

Wendy
It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.

Bebe
Oh please, you're lying. 

Officer
Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. 

Stan
Wendy! 

Kenny
(Aah-) 

Bebe
Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.

Officer
You can explain all that downtown. 

Stan
Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 

Stan
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?

Kyle
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.

Stan
...Abe Lincoln?

Wendy
Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 

Stan
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 

Character
Line
Cartman
AHHHHHH.

Dentist
Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.

Cartman
What?

Liane
Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?

Dentist
It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!

Cartman
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!

Dentist
Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?

Cartman
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!

Dentist
Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.

Cartman
...Ice cream?

Dentist
It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.

Liane
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?

Cartman
Well...you did say free ice cream? 

Liane
Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.

Cartman
Uh. It's over?

Liane
That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!

Cartman
Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!

Liane
I'm so proud of you, Eric.

Cartman
All right, so where's my ice cream?

Liane
Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.

Cartman
You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!

Doctor
No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.

Liane
...What!?

Cartman
What's that supposed to mean?!

Doctor
During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.

Cartman
I HAVE AIDS?

Doctor
Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.

Cartman
SORRY?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE SORRY?!

Liane
Oh, my poor little baby!

Cartman
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!

Liane
Oh God!  Oh no!

Cartman
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!

Doctor
We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. 

Cartman
Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!

Liane
Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!

Cartman
NO! NOOOOOOOO!

Principal Victoria
Thank you for coming, everyone. 

Principal Victoria
Boys, please take a seat.

Stan
What's going on? Are we in trouble?

Principal Victoria
Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.

Stan
...What?

Butters
Oh no.

Doctor 2
He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.

Kyle
Cartman has HIV?

Doctor 2
We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-

Kyle
Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?

Principal Victoria
All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?

Mr. Mackey
Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say Hi, m'kay? 

Kyle
...No. Way.

Butters
How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 

Cartman
God damn it, this sucks ass!

Kyle
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 

Butters
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.

Cartman
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!

Doctor 2
No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-

Cartman
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!

M.C.
We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. 

Cartman
Where the hell is everybody? 

Liane
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?

Waitress
This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.

Butters
Great benefit, Eric!

Jimmy
The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.

Cartman
So this is it?

Waitress
I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. 

Cartman
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!

M.C.
With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.

Cartman
Just bring out Elton John already!

M.C.
Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.

Waitress
It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!

Cartman
Jimmy Buffett?!

Jimmy Buffett
Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!

Cartman
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!

Jimmy Buffett
A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?

Cartman
Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!

Liane
Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.

Cartman
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!

Cartman
Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.

Stan
Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.

Cartman
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.

Stan
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?

Cartman
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!

Kyle
I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.

Cartman
No you don't!

Kyle
I do. 

Cartman
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!

Kyle
I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 

Cartman
Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!

Stan
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.

Cartman
Ironic how?

Stan
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...

Cartman
Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!

Stan
Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.

Cartman
Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!

Butters
Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.

Cartman
All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 

Butters
Okay, but... what are you going to do?

Cartman
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.

Butters
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.

Cartman
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.

Butters
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?

Cartman
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.

Butters
Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.

Cartman
All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.

Butters
Wow, you really know what you're doing.

Cartman
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 

Kyle
Wagh.

Sheila
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?

Dr. Doctor
No, it isn't strep...

Sheila
Oh, well there's a relief.

Dr. Doctor
...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?

Sheila
No, why?

Dr. Doctor
Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?

Kyle
What? No?!

Sheila
Doctor, what are you saying?

Dr. Doctor
We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.

Kyle
What?

Sheila
HIV?

Dr. Doctor
It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.

Sheila
No, that's impossible!

Dr. Doctor
Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?

Kyle
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 

Sheila
Kyle? Kyle!

Cartman
Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!

Kyle
I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!

Cartman
Kyle, what?!

Stan
What did he do?

Kyle
Why do I have HIV?!

Clyde
...Oh...

Cartman
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?

Kyle
What did you do?!

Cartman
Nothing!

Kyle
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 

Cartman
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 

Kyle
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!

Cartman
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-

Kyle
AAAAAAA! 

Cartman
Kyle!

Kyle
Here you go!  Here you go! 

Mr.Mackey
Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?!  Break it up! Hm'kay?!  M'kay!

Principal Victoria
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?

Kyle
He gave me AIDS!

Principal Victoria
What?

Kyle
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!

Principal Victoria
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?

Cartman
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!

Principal Victoria
Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!

Cartman
Kind of.

Mr. Mackey
Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!

Principal Victoria
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.

Cartman
I'm sorry.

Kyle
An apology?!

Principal Victoria
You're sorry for what, Eric?

Cartman
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.

Principal Victoria
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.

Kyle
...What?!

Mr. Mackey
Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?

Kyle
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!

Cartman
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 

Cartman
Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?

Kyle
I'm going to break everything that you own! 

Cartman
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!

Cartman
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!

Kyle
There is no cure, you asshole!

Cartman
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.

Kyle
What hope?!

Cartman
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.

Kyle
You're lying!

Cartman
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.

Kyle
Magic Johnson?

Cartman
He was a basketball player.

Kyle
So what?!

Cartman
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!

Kyle
You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!

Cartman
My God...

Cartman
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.

Clerk
Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.

Cartman
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.

Clerk
...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.

Cartman
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!

Kyle
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!

Clerk
Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?

Kyle
NO!

Clerk
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?

Cartman
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.

Clerk
Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?

Cartman
Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 

Flight Attendant
We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?

Cartman
Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.

Flight Attendant
I'm so sorry

Cartman
Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.

Flight Attendant
Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.

Cartman
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.

Kyle
Don't. Touch me.

Cartman
I know. I'm scared too.

Butler
Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. 

Kyle
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.

Magic
You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?

Cartman
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.

Kyle
Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!

Cartman
Kyle, we need to try to find a-

Kyle
What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!

Cartman
I don't think it's funny, Kyle.

Kyle
Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!

Cartman
Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-

Kyle
Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!

Cartman
Are you sure?

Kyle
Yes!!

Cartman
Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!

Magic
Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. 

Kyle
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?

Magic
Well, not at all.

Magic
The pool is over there , where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen  is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.

Kyle
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?

Magic
Sure.

Magic
Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. 

Kyle
Dude.

Magic
Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.

Kyle
You sleep with money. Every night?

Magic
Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?

Scientist 1
It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look.  That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right?  All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. 

Mitch
My God. The HIV particles are receding! 

Scientist 1
The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.

Scientist 2
Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.

Kyle
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...

Mitch
Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.

Magic
I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!

Scientist 2
Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!

Magic
These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen.  Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.

Scientist 2
Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.

Kyle
Wugh.

Scientist 2
I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.

Cartman
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.

Mitch
Let's hope to Christ this works. 

Scientist 1
Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look!  The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood!  Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.

Cartman
All right!

Scientist 1
They found the cure for AIDS!  The cure for AIDS!

Scientist 3
What is it?

Scientist 1
Large doses of concentrated cash!  Get the media on the phone!

Scientist 4
All right!

Anchorman
Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS.  About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.

Driver
Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!

M.C.
I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.  Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds , these two brave friends-

Kyle
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!

M.C.
These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!

Cartman
What?! Aw, no!

Jimmy Buffett
Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!

Cartman
What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.

Kyle
I'm still breaking your Xbox. 

Cartman
What? No. No.  Kyle, no!

Announcer
Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008.

Moderator
Good evening and welcome to the political debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama.  First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent?

Stan
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?

Randy
This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.

Cartman
Yeah, but we totally don't.

Randy
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!

Moderator
And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?

Barack Obama
Well, my opinion is that-

Announcer
We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch!  Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!

Butters
Man...

Randy
Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?

Anchorman
Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.

Robert Pooner
Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. 

Cartman
Aw dude, that's our town!

Robert Pooner
Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground , and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. 

Randy
She's such a train wreck!

Robert Pooner
When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. 

Ron
This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight.

Robert Pooner
That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! 

Butters
Aw, poor girl.

Randy
Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 

Ron
The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.

Kyle
A hundred thousand dollars?

Cartman
That's enough to buy slaves!

Ron
Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.

Hillary Clinton
...and spearchuckers.

Kyle
Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.

Stan
And she's at a hotel in our town. 

Kyle
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.

Cartman
Sweet!

Butters
Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.

Stan
Butters, don't be such a pussy.

Butters
Hokay. 

Kyle
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!

Butters
Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 

Stan
Oh no.

Kyle
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!

Photographer 1
Join the club.

Photographer 2
Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!

Cartman
We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 

Guard
Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.

Kyle
We uh, we have special permission?

Stan
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.

Guard
You are?

Butters
Not me! I'm a squirrel!

Britney
But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- 

Guard
Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.

Britney
My boys? Really? Send them in.  It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. 

Kyle
We did it guys!

Stan
I told you that would work!

The Boys
Yehehahah, all right!

Kyle
Ahall right!

Britney
You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?

Kyle
All right. Butters, go get next to her.

Butters
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!

Stan
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?

Britney
You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?

Butters
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 

Kyle
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!

Stan
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.

Cartman
All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.

Britney
I've got a better idea.

Stan
You do?

Britney
Yeah. 

Stan, Kyle
NO! 

Butters
You killed her! 

Guard
Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.

Nurse
Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? 

Stan
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.

Kyle
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.

Doctor
She's... alive.

Kyle
Whew.

Stan
Oh, thank God.

Doctor
But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?

Kyle
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?

Doctor
I don't want you making her upset.

Stan
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.

Doctor
All right.

Doctor
Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. 

Kyle
Oh my God!

Stan
Oh no!

Doctor
The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney.  Right, boys?!

Kyle
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 

Doctor
Well, I'll let you boys have your say. 

Stan
Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.

Kyle
Oh, God, what have we done?!

Announcer
It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!

Reporter
You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy no top part of my head look. This video  was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here , you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past.

Anchorman
O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical no top of the head look?

Chris
No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.

Kyle
Dude! 

Doctor
Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!

Manager
Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.

Britney
Guglo.

Manager
Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.

Paparazzo
Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. 

Doctor
Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.

Britney
Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?

Stan
Yeah, of course. 

Manager
Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 

Photographer 3
Hey look!

Photographer 4
There she is! 

Kyle
Oh crap! 

Stan
Jesus Christ!

Manager
Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks. 

Stan
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.

Manager
That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.

Kyle
What?!

Manager
All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.

Kyle
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?

Sound Engineer
All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. 

Female Aide
God, what a train wreck.

Male Aide
She must be stoned again. 

Stan
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.

Manager
Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be love elation. Sounds more like you're saying love creation.

Britney
Gogehah.

Manager
E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.

Britney
Egeul-gageol

Sound Engineer
Gah, she's so stupid.

Stan
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!

Sound Engineer
I know. She's really dumb, huh? 

Stan
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!

Sound Engineer
Yeah. And she's all fat, too.

Britney
Okel?

Announcer
Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards

VJ
What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! 

Kyle
Aw come on now, people! 

Woman
Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. 

Singers
The way she fee-els.  Love inside.

Man
Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.

Stan
She doesn't have any lips!

Singers
Temporary.  So hot! 

Reporter
Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.

Manager
Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 

Stan
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.

Kyle
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?

Stan
I know where.

Stan
We want three tickets to the North Pole. 

Clerk
The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?

Stan
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 

Announcer
It's Britney Wowtch!

Ron
A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! 

Robert Pooner
Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. 

Ron
Oooooh, ouch!

Anchorwoman
Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.

Leslie
Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.

Ron
Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? 

Robert Pooner
She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.

Ron
Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.

Tracy
The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.

Ron
Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.

Kyle
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.

Paparazzo
There she is! It's Britney! 

Stan
Oh no. 

Stan
Dude, they're never gonna let us through.

Kyle
Yes they are! I have an idea.

Paparazzo 2
Britney? Where'd she go?

Paparazzo 3
There she is! 

Stan
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 

Manager
There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?

Reporter
Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!

Kyle
I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!

Paparazzo 5
Ooo, psych!

Manager
She must be back at the train station; come on! 

Kyle
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?

Paparazzo 6
Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.

Kyle
Huh? 

Paparazzo 7
What do you think all this effort has been for?

Manager
It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.

Officer
She must... die.

Background Singers
Hetus. Alte omnebus.  Virtu e poquebus. 

Narrator
Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.

Stan
You doing okay, Ms. Spears? 

Conductor
It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears;  it looks just like the picture.  You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand.  Rectus. Hoc honebus

Elderly Man
Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.

Kyle
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!

Bob Summers
Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?

Kyle
NO!

Paparazzo 8
Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.

Bob Summers
In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.

Paparazzo 9
We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times.

Paparazzo 10
Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.

Canadian Paparazzo
It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.

Woman
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.

Kyle
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?

Man
Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.

Paparazzo 11
All right, everyone's about here.

Kyle
Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!

Male passenger
Hey, where are we? This isn't right. 

Stan
Oh no!

Britney
Ohhh thoooo!

Stan
Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on! 

Kyle
Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?

Gerald
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.

Kyle
Be a good boy? You know all about this?

Stan
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?

Kyle
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!

Stan
Sacrificed? For what?

Randy
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.

Canadian Paparazzo
Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.

Kyle
Corn harvest!

Randy
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.

Stan
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!

Manager
The kid is right. This has gone on too long.

Paparazzo 12
Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.

Farmer
And harvest is coming soon.

Bob Summers
All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. 

Stan
No wait. 

Woman 2
Come on, hurry up.

Woman 3
I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya. 

Mother
Here Davey. 

Bob Summers
Hold on. 

Doctor
She's dead.

Randy
Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 

Gil
Mornin' Bill.

Bill
Mornin' Gil.

Gil
Nice-lookin' corn.

Sheila
Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? 

Randy
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.

ET Reporter
She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.

Jimbo
Hey, check it out! 

Randy
Looks like next harvest will be even better. 

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it The Choking Game, hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?

Kyle
You can get high from choking yourself? 

Mr. Mackey
Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?

Butters
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.

Cartman
Cat pee? 

Stan
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?

Mr. Mackey
Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.

Cartman
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 

Kyle
You guys are wasting your time.

Stan
Yeah, this is not gonna work.

Cartman
Okay, ready Kenny?

Kenny
(All set.)

Cartman
All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 

Kenny
(Ow.)

Kyle
Whoa! 

Stan
Do you feel anything?

Cartman
Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 

Kenny
(Hey cool! Check it out!)

Father
I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.

Kenny
(Yeahhh!)

Father
Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.

Kenny
(Okay.) 

Cartman
Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!

Kenny
(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 

Cartman
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.

Kenny
(You fucking asshole!)

Cartman
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?

Kenny
(What the fuck did you do that for?)

Cartman
Ah, Kenny! 

Kyle
Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!

Kenny
(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)

Stan
What titties?

Kenny
(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)

Kyle
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.

Stan
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.

Kenny
(I almost... touched them.)

Kyle
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.

Announcer
Next on FOX News!  It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! 

Gerald
Killing our kids? 

Reporter
All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine!  Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state  and is also referred to as... cheesing.  Why cheesing? Because it's fon to due.  This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months.

Girl
We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.

Gerald
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!

Reporter
So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? 
1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.
You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as Hey, let's go cheese. or Do you feel like cheesing, guys? or Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now.

Sheila
Kids are doing this?

Reporter
Kids do it because it's legal.  What can you do before it's too late? 

Gerald
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.

Gerald
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as the cheese game, or vitamin cheese, or Mary Jane piss in your face fun time. Cheesing is spreading fast.

Sharon
All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?

Gerald
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.

Stephen
Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!

Gerald
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!

Randy
Let's hear it for Gerald!

Stephen
Hooray for Gerald! 

Ruby Tucker
No! No!

Agent 1
Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie.  Jeez... 

Girl 2's Father
Goodbye, Scrambles.  We'll miss you. 

Agent 2
Got two here.

Kenny
(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)

Agent 1
Sorry, these are illegal.

Kenny
(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 

Cartman
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.

Kyle
Guys, have you seen Kenny?

Stan
Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.

Kyle
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.

Butters
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.

Stan
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.

Cartman
Yeah, who has cats these days? 

Kyle
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.

Kenny
(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)

Kyle
Kenny? 

Stan
Kenny, you home? 

Kenny
(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) 

Kyle
Kenny!

Kenny
(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)

Butters
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 

Stan, Kyle
Kenny!

Butters
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.

Kyle
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.

Kenny
(No we don't, guys.)

Stan
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.

Kenny
(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)

Kyle
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 

Butters
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.

Stan
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.

Kenny
(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)

Butters
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?

Kyle
We've gotta keep this away from him.

Cartman
Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 

Cartman
All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 

Sheila
Huh?  Oh my God... 

Gerald
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?

Kyle
Yeah?

Gerald
Kyle, have you been getting high?!

Kyle
No.

Gerald
Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!

Kyle
All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.

Sheila
Don't lie to us, Kyle!

Gerald
How long have you been on the cheese?!

Kyle
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.

Gerald
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!

Kyle
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?

Gerald
Now, Kyle!

Kyle
God! 

Sheila
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!

Gerald
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!

Sheila
What are you gonna do?

Gerald
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 

Gerald
No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 

Gerald
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!

Cartman
Who is it?!

Woman
Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.

Cartman
Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 

Woman
You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.

Cartman
Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.

Woman
But they will find him.

Cartman
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...

Woman
Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 

Cartman
What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!

Kenny
(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 

Cartman
Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.

Kyle
Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 

Stan
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.

Cartman
He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.

Kyle
What?

Stan
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.

Kyle
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!

Cartman
They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 

Stan
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.

Kyle
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?

Gerald
Hey everybody. Good to see you again. 

Father
Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!

Gerald
Huh... how come?

Father
There is... another suitor. 

Gerald
What?  Get out of here, kid!

Kenny
(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)

Gerald
You're too young for this stuff!

Father
This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! 

Father
Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! 

Kyle
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!

Jimbo
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.

Gerald
She's mine, you little asshole!

Kenny
(Get the fuck off of me!)

Sheila
Gerald?!

Reporter
The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.

Gerald
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.

Sheila
Don't touch me.

Gerald
And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.

Stan
What the hell is he talking about?

Kyle
I have no idea.

Gerald
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.

Randy
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 

Gerald
Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 

Kenny
(Yeah. I guess so.)

Gerald
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-

Stephen
Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.

Gerald
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 

Girl 2's Father
Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya?  Ahh! Get him off! 

Stan
I'm sure glad that's over with. 

Kenny
(Me too.)

Cartman
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 

Kyle
And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?

Cartman
Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.

Stan
You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.

Kyle
Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 

Cartman
Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.

Kyle
Kenny! 

Stan
What the hell kind of flowers are those?

Kyle
Kenny? Kenny?!

Mr. Mackey
Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.

Cartman
Oh God, I'm bored already.

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? 

WCB President
Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up.  Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?

Cartman
Gayness! 

Stephen Abootman
That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?

Craig
Nothing! 

Stephen Abootman
My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! 

Man 1
Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!

Lumberjack
It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?

Stephen Abootman
That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!

Woman 1
Did you say strike?

Stephen Abootman
Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!

Man 2
Canada, on strike.

Man 3
Canada, on strike.

Canadians
Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says No more!
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats

Border Guard
Can all just take a hike! 

Canadians
It's Canaada! On Strike!
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's ,
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
And with our fingers up your ass,

It's Canada! On Strike!
And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! 
Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!

Café 180 Patron
That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
It's Canada! On Strike!

Canadians
It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!

Swiss Delegate
Ahhh, when you say Canada is on strike, what exactly do you mean?

Stephen Abootman
What do you think it means?!  We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want

French Delegate
Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?

Stephen Abootman
I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!

French Delegate
The WGA?

Stephen Abootman
Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! 

French Delegate
What exactly does Canada want?

Stephen Abootman
We want: more... money!

Aide 1
Yeah! More money!

Japanese Delegate
More money from where?

Stephen Abootman
Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!

Aide 1
Yeah! Give us Internet money!

British Delegate
A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-

Stephen Abootman
Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! 

British Delegate
I'm afraid we can't.

Stephen Abootman
Then you leave Canada no choice.  This strike shall continue! 

Husband
Honk if you support Canada He- hey honey, watch this. 

Wife
Oh, we're supporting unions.

Husband
That's right; we're a very progressive couple.

Wife
Yes.  Oh, that's fun!

Husband
Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.

Wife
Oh really? Goodie! 

Kyle
Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.

Cartman
We don't care. *urp*

Kyle
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!

Stan
Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!

Aww, this one again?!

Stan
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!

Terrance
Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.

Phillip
Oh? Does it run on electricity?

Terrance
No, it uses natural gas. 

Phillip
Not as fat as your face!

Butters
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.

Cartman
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!

Kyle
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!

Stan
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 

Peter Griffin
You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang La Cucaracha for Paul McCartney?

Cartman
No! NOOO!

Peter Griffin
La Cucaracha-  We are NOT... resorting to that!

Canadians
We want more! We want more!

Stephen Abootman
One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! 

Terrance
Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.

Stephen Abootman
Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!

Terrance
But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.

Stephen Abootman
Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!

Terrance
Don't call me a rat, buddih!

Stephen Abootman
I'm not your buddih, friend!

Phillip
He's not your friend, guy!

Stephen Abootman
I'm not your guy, buddih!

Terrance
He's not your buddih, friend!

Stephen Abootman
I'm not your friend, guy!  Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!

Weird Hat Guy
Yah, you think this is funnih?

Stephen Abootman
Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!

Aide 1
Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!

Stephen Abootman
What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later!  Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this.  Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA.

Kyle
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 

Stephen Abootman
Oh you do, huh?!  They've had enough. They want us to end the strike.  Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this.  All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!

Kyle
We totally think you should have more money.

Stephen Abootman
Wwe got 'em! We did it!  All right, how much are you gonna give us?

Kyle
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.

Stephen Abootman
Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!

Kyle
The Internet?

Stephen Abootman
You listen to me, friend!  You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead!  Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.

Stan
What'd they say?

Kyle
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.

Cartman
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?

Butters
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?

Kyle
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.

Cartman
Wait. I've got it.

Butters
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please

A Nun
Oh my.

Butters
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

Cartman
There's more people viewing it!

Stan
This is going great!

Kyle
Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 

Tom
And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.

Aide 1
How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!

Stephen Abootman
Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.

Tom
In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called What What (In My Asshole).

Reporter
Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America.  The boy in the video, referred to by most as that little gay kid,  has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show.

Stephen Abootman
Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!

Phillip
Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?

Stephen Abootman
We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!

Phillip
Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.

Terrance
Yeah, let's give it up, guy.

Stephen Abootman
Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!

Terrance
Well I'm not your friend, buddih!

Stephen Abootman
Well I'm not your buddih, guy!

Woman 2
Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!

Tom
And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. 

Stephen Abootman
All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen.

Tom
In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.

Stephen Abootman
What?

Female Reporter
Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?

Danish Man
Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.

Danish Woman
Nobody knows where Denmark is.

Danish Man
Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.

Stephen Abootman
SCABS! How could you?! 

Stan
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.

Clerk
Take a number and wait with everyone else.

Cartman
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.

Clerk
Take a number and wait with everyone else! 

Black Man
Chocolate Raaain.

Butters
Aaah. 

Tron Guy
Hey, I know you. You're the What What (In My Asshole) kid.

Butters
What What (In The Butt), sir.

Stan
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.

Tron Guy
Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. 

Numa Numa
Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha

Tron Guy
And the Star Wars kid.  And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda.  And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. 

Cartman
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!

Chocolate Rain Guy
So, how many people have seen your Internet video?

Butters
Uhhh a few hundred thousand?

Chocolate Rain Guy
Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.

Cartman
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.

Chris Crocker
Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! 

Kyle
Excuse me.  Hello?

Stephen Abootman
You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.

Kyle
Wait we're working on it.

Stephen Abootman
You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already.  You've got me over a barrel and you know it!

Kyle
Sir, we're doing everything we can.

Stephen Abootman
You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood!  Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die.

Kyle
We don't want you to die.

Stephen Abootman
Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. 

Kyle
We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?

Chocolate Rain Guy
I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.

Star Wars Kid
Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!

Chocolate Rain Guy
I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.

Tron Guy
Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! 

Chocolate Rain Guy
You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!

Afro Ninja
Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.

Star Wars Kid
Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!

Chocolate Rain Guy
You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! 

Chris Crocker
NOOO! 

Numa Numa Guy
Haw!

Kyle
Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.

Tron Guy
Hai Hayaaa!

Numa Numa
Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah- 

Chris Crocker
Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! 

Chocolate Rain Guy
Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! 

Chris Crocker
Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! 

Chocolate Rain Guy
Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?!  Ughhh, my brains. 

Cartman
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.

Aide 1
Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!

Stephen Abootman
What?! You mean it?! 

Kyle
Okay, we did it.

Stephen Abootman
Who the hell are you?

Stan
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.

Kyle
Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 

Stephen Abootman
Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?!  You little timewasters!

Stan
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!

Kyle
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.

Cartman
...You are a homo, Butters.

Kyle
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!

Stephen Abootman
Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it!  Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.

Swiss Delegate
Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.

Stephen Abootman
You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!

French Delegate
No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. 

Kyle
Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!

Swiss Delegate
Excuse me?

Kyle
He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!

French Delegate
Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize

Kyle
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?

Stephen Abootman
Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?

Kyle
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?

Swiss Delegate
Sure, why not?

Stephen Abootman
We have won! 

Lumberjack
Well how much did we get?

Stephen Abootman
Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these...  coupons to Bennigan's! And...  free bubblegum... for every Canadian.  These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.

Aide 1
We did it! 

Stephen Abootman
My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. 

Kyle
Ike. Ike!  It's over.

Ike
It's over?

Kyle
Yeah. Here you go. 

Stan
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Butters
Me too!

Kyle
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.

Stan
...Yeah.

Stephen Abootman
Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! 

Terrance
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!

Phillip
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!

Stephen Abootman
Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.

Phillip
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!

Stephen Abootman
Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. 

Stephen Abootman
Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!

Terrance
We're setting you adrift, idiot!

Phillip
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!

Stephen Abootman
You'll regret this day, friend!

Phillip
I'm not your friend, buddih!

Stephen Abootman
I'm not your buddih, guy!

Terrance
He's not your guy, friend!

Stephen Abootman
I'm not your friend, buddih!

Terrance & Phillip
We're not your buddih, guy!

Stephen Abootman
I'm not your guy, friend!

Mrs. Garrison
It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man

Butters
Are we gonna get tested on this?

Mrs. Garrison
This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.

Stan
Dude, wanna do some math problems?

Mrs. Garrison
And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man, and he says There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?  Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?!  I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis! 

Principal Victoria
Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?

Mrs. Garrison
What do you want? I'm trying to teach.

Mr. Mackey
Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? 

Mrs. Garrison
Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! 

Principal Victoria
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.

Cartman
Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.

Principal Victoria
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 

Cartman
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!

Principal Victoria
Any other volunteers, perhaps?

Cartman
Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.

Principal Victoria
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.

Cartman
Yes! 

Principal Victoria
Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!

Kyle
You're not the teacher, fatass.

Cartman
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 

News Anchor
And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse  genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.

Mrs. Garrison
What?

News Anchor
But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.

Mrs. Garrison
Holy Freaking Jesus.

Researcher 1
Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television.  Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person.

Mrs. Garrison
Doctor, what about a penis?

Researcher 1
Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.

Mrs. Garrison
No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?

Researcher 1
You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.

Mrs. Garrison
I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis.

Researcher 1
All right.  All right, let's see what we can do.

Principal Victoria
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.

Cartman
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!

Mr. Mackey
Uh, commend means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?

Principal Victoria
After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.

Cartman
Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.

Principal Victoria
These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.

Board Rep 1
Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.

Board Rep 2
These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?

Cartman
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?

Cartman
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.

Kyle
You're not an awesome teacher!

Cartman
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.

Kyle
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!

Cartman
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?

Kyle
Kenny's!

Kenny
(Yeah, that was my idea.)

Cartman
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.

Kyle
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 

Cartman
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.

Principal
Students, quiet! Quiet please!  Give me your attention!

Teen Boy 1
I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller. 

Mrs. Miller
You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher.

Class
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.

Mrs. Miller
This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez

Cartman
Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.

Teen Boy 2
What the hell is thiiis?

Cartman
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.

Researcher 1
Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.

Mrs. Garrison
Mr. Garrison! 

Researcher 1
Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis. 

Mrs. Garrison
Wow! My penis looks great!

Researcher 1
Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.

Mrs. Garrison
How long before it's ready?

Researcher 1
Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.

Mrs. Garrison
Let me see if it feels right in my hand. 

Researcher 1
No! Don't open the- 

Mrs. Garrison
Whoa no!

Researcher 2
Don't let it get out of the lab! 

Mrs. Garrison
Mah penis!  Stop, penis! Come back here!

Cartman
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.

Teen Boy 3
Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!

Teen Boy 4
Yeahhhh.

Cartman
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge

Teen Boy 5
Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! 

Cartman
How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.

Teen Girl 1
Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!

Cartman
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.

Teen Boy 6
This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.

Cartman
Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?

Mrs. Garrison
Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? 

Kyle
What?

Mrs. Garrison
My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. 

Butters
Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.

Cartman
Nice form, compadre. 

Teen Boy 6
Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.

Cartman
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 

Teen Boy 7
Sure thing, Mr. C.

Cartman
Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 

Teen Boy 6
AAAAH! 

Cartman
Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!

Teen Boy 6
You cheated!

Cartman
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 

Teen Boy 6
Fuck you, man, you can't do that!

Cartman
Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 

Teen Boy 6
I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. 

Cartman
Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?

Linda
What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!

Stephen
What is it, dear?

Linda
A penis is loose in our kitchen!

Stephen
A penis?

Linda
Yes! It just ran across the floor!

Stephen
Now darling, calm down.

Linda
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!

Stephen
Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. 

Linda
There! There, you see it?

Stephen
Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.

Linda
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 

Butters
Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!

Stephen
Your teacher's penis?

Butters
Yeah, that must be his.

Stephen
Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?

Butters
Huh?

Cartman
Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 

Teen Boy 6
I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.

Cartman
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: I mis-interpreted the rules. It's what you must also say when caught cheating! I mis-interpreted the rules. Say it with me.

Class
I mis-interpreted the rules.

Cartman
Good. Again.

Class
I mis-interpreted the rules.

Cartman
Again!

Class
I mis-interpreted the rules.

Cartman
Now you sound like white people!

Class
I mis-interpreted the rules!

Mrs. Garrison
What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!

Stephen
Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.

Mrs. Garrison
Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!

A Woman
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! 

Mrs. Garrison
Holy Crap! 

Woman
Eeeek! Eeeeeek!

Husband
Carole, get down from there!

Woman
Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!

Husband
I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.

Mrs. Garrison
You saw a penis?!

Woman 2
Eeeeeeeek! 

Woman 2
Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. 

Mrs. Garrison
Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!

Cartman
The answer to #27 is 5.

Class
The answer to #27 is 5.

Cartman
The answer to #28 is 14.

Class
The answer to #28 is 14.

Teen Girl 2
Man, what's the point?  What's the point of any of this? 

Cartman
All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?

Melita
There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.

Cartman
How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.

Melita
No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.

Cartman
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?

Melita
That cheating is good?

Cartman
Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.

Melita
I don't know, Mr. C.

Cartman
Mexicans are told not to cheat. Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child. So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.

Sgt. Yates
And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? 

Mrs. Garrison
That's right.

Officer Harris
Long whiskers or short?

Mrs. Garrison
Short, and little fluffy ears.

Officer Harris
Fluffy ears, okay.

Mrs. Garrison
Think you got it, Mitch?

Mitch Harris
I think so, sir. Is this pretty close? 

Mrs. Garrison
No, no, not like that! That's just silly. 

Officer
Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.

Sgt. Yates
What is it?

Officer
Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.

Mrs. Garrison
Wall come on! 

Woman 2
EEK!

Man 2
What's the matter?

Woman 2
A penis!

Woman 3
A penis? Where?

Woman 4
There it is!  Eek! 

Mrs. Garrison
Where is it?!

Mitch Harris
Look, there! 

Mrs. Garrison
Come on! 

Chef
What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? 

Mrs. Garrison
Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis!  Crap! We've gotta go back around!

Mouse
Someone somewhere is loving me tonightLooking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.

Penis
Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair

Mouse
Feelin' my despair

Penis
And this same moon is

Penis, Mouse
making them think of that-.

Mrs. Garrison
There it is!  No! Nooo!  No! No!

Mitch Harris
There's not a chance now.

Mrs. Garrison
No we, we can find it! 

Sgt. Yates
Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. 

Mrs. Miller
Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.

Cartman
Uh what?

Mrs. Miller
The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud. 

Teen Boy 8
Monitor us in a private room?

Teen Boy 3
Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.

Teen Boy 2
I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!

Cartman
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.

Teen Boy 8
Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!

Cartman
How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat. You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.

Teen Girl 1
Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.

Cartman
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.

Mrs. Garrison
You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  Well what the?  Why... it's my penis.  My penis came back. But why?  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? If you love your penis, let it go...

Mrs. Miller
The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100% 

Teen Boy 6
Uh, can we say something?

Mrs. Miller
Sure. 

Teen Boy 6
We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! 

Cartman
I reeached these keeeds.

Principal Victoria
Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 

Mr. Garrison
Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.

A Teacher
Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.

Mr. Garrison
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!

Sharon
Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.

Stan
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things

Sharon
Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!

Stan
Aw man! 

Sharon
Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.

Shelly
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!

Sharon
Now, Shelly! 

Shelly
Why do you hate me?!

Sharon
Randy, off the Internet.

Randy
Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.

Sharon
No, mister, it's time for night-night.

Randy
But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-

Sharon
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 

Randy
One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 

Stan
What the hell?

Randy
Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 

Stan
What?

Randy
My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?

Stan
My Internet's not working either.

Randy
What?! 

Shelly
Dad, the Internet's not working!

Randy
I know that, okay?!

Shelly
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!

Sharon
Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.

Randy
Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 

Randy
Gerald. Please help us.

Gerald
Randy. What happened?

Randy
Our house... It has no Internet.

Sheila
Oh my God.

Randy
We've got nothing! It's just gone.

Gerald
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.

Randy
Thank you Gerald. 

Stan
I'm getting on it first.

Randy
Oh no you're not!

Stan
Kyle, I need to use your Internet

Kyle
Ih it's not working.

Randy
What?!

Kyle
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.

Gerald
No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.

Randy
It's not working, Gerald.

Gerald
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-

Randy
Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!

Kyle
I have to get online before school.

Stan
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.

Randy
Right, Starbucks!

Gerald
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.

Stephen
Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?

Randy
No! Nobody's is!

Man 1
Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!

Randy
Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.

Gerald
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 

Randy
God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 

Gerald
Get out of the way, Peterson! 

Clerk
Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.

Kyle
It's not working here?

Randy
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.

Man 2
No, don't. You're wasting your time.

Randy
How do you know?!

Man 2
Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!

Gerald
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!

Stephen
Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.

Randy
Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!

Mr. Garrison
There has to be a way to find out what's going on.

Gerald
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!

Man 3
What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?

Randy
A television! 

Anchorman
Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.

Randy
Jesus, it's statewide.

Gerald
It could be nationwide.

Anchorman
Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. 

Gerald
No Internet... anywhere...

Randy
Jesus... we're all alone... 

Sharon
What's the matter?

Randy
I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 

Shelly
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 

Randy
Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!

Stan
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!

Randy
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.

Gerald
Randy, where will you go?

Randy
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.

Gerald
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.

Randy
Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!

Stephen
It could come back.

Randy
Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.

Stephen
Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?

Randy
How. You won't have Internet. 

Motel Clerk
Sorry folks, we're full up.

Randy
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.

Motel Clerk
You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.  It's about a mile down the road.

Randy
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 

Transient Man 1
Where are you from, old-timer?

Old-Timer
Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.

Transient Man 2
Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.

Transient Man 3
Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.

Transient Man 4
When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.

Transient Man 1
Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.

Randy
Sure will be nice. 

Transient Man 5
You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?

Randy
That's right. We need to get online.

Transient Man 5
Haha. Get online he says.

Stan
What's so funny about that?

Transient Man 5
Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there?  Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead.  Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... 

Randy
Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 

Shelly
Amiiir... I miss you so much...

Stan
Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 

Randy
Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 

Worker
Name?

Randy
Do they have Internet here?

Worker
Name?

Randy
Marsh.

Worker
Service provider?

Randy
NetZero.

Worker
All right, stay in line.  Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.

Randy
So is there Internet here?

Worker 2
Stay in line and get to your campsite. 

Randy
Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.

Refugee Man 1
Yeah, they've got it here. 

Stan
All right!

Refugee Man 2
But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet.  Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully.

Refugee Man 3
Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.

Randy
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!

Volunteer 1
Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.

Refugee Man 4
Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.

Volunteer 2
All right, time's up.

Refugee Man 4
No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information!  NO! NOO!

Volunteer 2
Next? Brady, John H.

Randy
Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 

Sharon
What did you say?

Randy
Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.

Anchorman
And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. 

Anchorman 2
A fax! A fax is coming through! 

Anchorman
Oh yeah, a fax!!

Anchorman 2
Oh a fax!

Anchorman
It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!

Anchorman 2
It's a fax, we got a fax!  Uh-

Anchorman
Oh! it says, The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it.

Anchorman 2
We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!

Kyle
Where... is... the Internet?

General
Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.

Scientist 1
We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.

General
Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!

Scientist 2
Here it is, general. The Internet. 

General
What's wrong with it?

Scientist 2
See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.

General
My God.

Transient Man 6
Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum?  Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize! hoh, ahaha, ha.

Volunteer 2
All right, time's up.

Refugee Man 5
No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it.  No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!

Volunteer 2
Next? Nelson, Peter T.

Randy
Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.

Volunteer 3
Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.

Randy
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.

Volunteer 3
So jack off.

Randy
You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!

Volunteer 3
What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!

Randy
Three minutes would be plenty.

Volunteer 3
Get lost! 

Randy
Ohhh.

Sharon
All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.

Shelly
What number are you, turd?

Stan
Eight fifty one.

Shelly
You're nine twenty three now.

Stan
Hey! Mom!

Sharon
Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!

Shelly
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 

Refugee Man 5
Psst. Hey! Over here!  You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?

Randy
Yeah, how'd you know?

Refugee Man 5
Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.

Randy
I know, right?

Refugee Man 5
Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say click.

Randy
Internet Porn Simulator 

Refugee Man 5
Give it a try. 

Randy
Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.

Refugee Man 5
Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.

Randy
Well at least that part's like the Internet.

Anchorman
We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!

Field Reporter
Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.

General
All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! 

Kyle
Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...

Gerald
What is it, Kyle?

Kyle
I think... I know what's wrong.

Shelly
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!

Stan
It's gotta be our turn soon.

Volunteer 2
All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today.

Refugees
AWWW!!! 

Woman
A little closer!

Volunteer 2
No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow.  Everyone get to bed!

Refugees
Aw man! 

Woman
Wha?!

Shelly
Gggggyyaaah! 

Randy
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 

Girl 1
Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? 

Girl 2
Un. Choukawaii yo ne! 

Randy
Oh niice... Whoa... 

Girl 1
Watashi wa... daisuki! 

Randy
Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 

Refugee Man 2
What is that?

Refugee Man 4
Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.

Randy
Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!

Volunteer 4
Get the keys! We gotta get in there. 

Randy
Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 

Volunteer 2
What the...? 

Stan
Dad?

Sharon
Randy!

Randy
Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!

Volunteer 2
You son of a bitch!

Randy
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 

Field Reporter
This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy  to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.  It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?

Scientist 1
All clear for procedure.

General
All right! Let's do it! 

Scientist 2
Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!

Scientist 1
He did it!

Scientist 3
I've got Internet!

Scientist 4
Me too!

Scientist 5
Internet activity in all sectors, sir. 

Transient Man 5
I've got Internet.

Transient Man 6
Me too!

Transient Man 3
It's back! 

Anchorman
It's back? It's back! 

Shelly
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 

Amir
Shelly. Shelly Marsh? 

Shelly
What?

Amir
It's me. Amir.

Shelly
O... kay.

Amir
Your family came here too, huh?

Shelly
Yeah. 

Amir
So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.

Shelly
Yeah, okay. Sounds good.

Amir
Okay, s-see ya. 

Shelly
We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!

Randy
And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 

Mr. Garrison
Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. 

Pioneer Paul
Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?

Stan
Ughh.

Kyle
This is gonna suck.

Pioneer Paul
When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome.  To 1864. Set 'em up!

Mr. Garrison
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 

Cartman
Let's be partners, Kenny.

Kenny
(No, I'm partners with Craig) 

Cartman
Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 

Stan
Naw, I'm with Wendy.

Cartman
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.

Kyle
I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?

Cartman
Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?

Mr. Garrison
Eric, partner with Butters.

Cartman
God damn it!

Mr. Garrison
Hold Butters' hand, Eric! 

Cartman
That isn't necessary!

Mr. Garrison
Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!

Butters
I understand. 

Mr. Garrison
All right, let's head in. 

Cartman
You can let go now, Butters.

Butters
No.

Cartman
Butters, come on!

Butters
No! 

Mr. Garrison
All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!

Smithy
Why howdy partners.  I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?

Stan
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.

Wendy
Thanks, Stan.

Pioneer Paul
These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?

Kyle
That guy is wearing a digital watch.

Smithy
Oh jeez. 

Pioneer Paul
Damn it Chad!

Chad
S-sorry, I'm sorry.

Gunsmith
Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.

Cartman
I wanna shoot an Indian.

Gunsmith
Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. 

Butters
Do you see any Indians?

Cartman
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  Super... Phun Thyme.  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!

Butters
Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.

Cartman
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!

Butters
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!

Cartman
Fine, then let go of my hand!

Butters
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!

Cartman
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!

Butters
I'm not lettin' go!

Cartman
Fine, then you're comin' with me!

Butters
No, Eric! 

Cartman
Butters, let go God-damn it!

Butters
No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!

Pioneer Paul
This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.

Clerk
Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.

Wendy
Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.

Clerk
What do you mean back then? Don't forget, it's 1864.

Kyle
Right. Except for it really isn't.

Pioneer Paul
Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. 

Kyle
What's that?

Stan
Sounds like police sirens.

Pioneer Paul
What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. 

Leader
We lost them, we lost them!

Injured Man
Damn pig cops!

Leader
Close that gate! 

Wendy
What's going on?

Stan
I don't know. 

Leader
Everyone down on the ground NOW!

Sheriff
Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- 

Stan
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?

Pioneer Paul
A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.

Stan
What?!

Kyle
Come on, this is serious!

Pioneer Paul
Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?

Clerk
Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.

Stan
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!

Pioneer Paul
If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.

Stan
This is not the time for that!

Cartman
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!

Butters
Well, that's your problem!

Cartman
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.

Butters
Make that two! 

Cashier
Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?

Butters, Cartman
NO! 

Cartman
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?

Butters
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!

Cartman
Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 

Wendy
Over here. This looks like an office.

Kyle
Here! Here's the phone! 

Pioneer Paul
Well, what a straaange contraption.

Wendy
I can't get a dial tone. 

Kyle
What's the number to dial out?

Pioneer Paul
Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.

Stan
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 

Clerk
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-

Pioneer Paul
Brresh! 

Clerk
Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.

Pioneer Paul
I'll say.

Kyle
I got through. Hello, police?

Operator
Nine one one, what's your emergency?

Kyle
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!

Operator
Taken hostage where?

Kyle
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.

Operator
You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?

Kyle
Sister, you don't know the half of it.

Cartman
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!

Cartman
Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 

Butters
What are you whoofelin' at? 

Cartman
Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!

Butters
Whoa! 

Cartman
Yeheah, we're wired up!

Cartman
Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 

Butters
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!

Cartman
Aw, just a few more things.

Butters
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!

Cartman
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 

Leader
Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area.  Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination.

Mr. Garrison
Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 

Blond
How did they find us?!

Leader
Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. 

Police Chief
All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.

Lieutenant
Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!

Police Chief
Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!

Officer
What did they rob, sir?

Police Chief
A Burger King.

Leader
All right, good. Is that all of it? 

Balding Man
No. Don't forget we've got these too.

Leader
Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  I'd like to speak with the chief of police!  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!

Kyle
Why aren't the cops coming in?

Wendy
They must be negotiating.

Pioneer Paul
Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.

Kyle
Will you shut up!

Stan
Wait, you have guns here?

Pioneer Paul
Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.

Stan
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!

Pioneer Paul
All righty. Come on, storehand.

Clerk
Yeppir! 

Cartman
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.

Butters
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.

Cartman
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.

Butters
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.

Cartman
Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.

Butters
What?! They called the cops?!

Cartman
They must have realized we left. Damn.

Butters
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!

Cartman
Shhh! Butters!

Butters
We're gonna get it now!

Cartman
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!

Butters
You just got me busted forever!

Cartman
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.

Butters
No! 

Cartman
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.

Butters
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 

Cartman
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.

Butters
No.

Cartman
Butters?

Butters
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.

Cartman
All right, come on! 

Leader
Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich.

Ohrlich
The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.

Leader
Above ground?

Ohrlich
Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft,  but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock.

Leader
So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.

Ohrlich
One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now.

Frans
What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?

Ohrlich
I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.

Frans
Very well. 

Frans
I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!

Smithy
I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village.  OW.

Frans
You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons,  Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!

Smithy
Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the-  OW.

Frans
That's it!  Tell me the code or you die!  One... two...

Smithy
I...

Frans
Yes?

Smithy
I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. 

Craig
These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 

Worker
No. Please. Don't hurt me.

Frans
Give us the code to that door and we can leave!

Worker
I've never heard of sss-something called a door code.  Please, can't you ask some other way?

Frans
I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! 

Worker
All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 

Pioneer Paul
What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.

Frans
God damn it you people are fucking insane!

Kyle
I don't believe it.

Frans
Domino,  Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! 

Wendy
Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! 

Jimmy
Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. 

Officer
Sector Bravo, no activity.

Butters
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.

Cartman
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.

Butters
That looks dangerous.

Cartman
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.

Butters
Oh gosh in heaven.

Cartman
It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.

Butters
Whoa!

Cartman
Save me!

Butters
I'm gonna fall! 

Cartman
... Oh dude, laaame.

Frans
Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?

Domino
We found somebody. 

Walsky
We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.

Pioneer Paul
You let out Murderin' Murphy?

Murderin' Murphy
Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!

Frans
Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!

Woman
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.

Frans
I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!

Pioneer Paul
You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.

Frans
I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! 

Mr. Garrison
Not me! Not me not me not me not me! 

Kenny
(What? Hey, let go.)

Frans
Do you want to see a child die?!

Kenny
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)

Butters
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!

Cartman
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!

Butters
Huh... 

Cartman
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!

Butters
Let's do it!

Cartman
Ready? Go! 

Frans
What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!

Woman
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.

Frans
God damn it!

Kyle
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!

Stan
I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 

Kyle
Stan?

Wendy
Where are you going, Stan?

Stan
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 

Frans
All right, that does it!  On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!

Kenny
(God damn it, someone help me!)

Stan
Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..

Pioneer Paul
Ohhh, welcome, partner. 

Frans
Wha-what are you doing?

Stan
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.

Pioneer Paul
That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.

Murderin' Murphy
They killed my pahr!

Stan
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.

Pioneer Paul
Y-y-yeah, I understand that.

Clerk
Finally, a fella that talks some sense.

Stan
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?

Pioneer Paul
Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.

Clerk
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.

Frans
Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! 

Mr. Garrison
No, you got your door code, let us go!

Walsky
Copy that. What's the code, over. 

Cartman
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?

Butters
Yeah, it sure has.

Cartman
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.

Butters
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...

Cartman
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.

Butters
Been a hoot all right!

Walsky
Get your hands behind your head!

Cartman
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.

Walsky
Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now!  Let go of each other!

Butters
Huh uh.

Walsky
Do what I tell you!

Butters
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!

Walsky
Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!

Cartman
Butters.

Walsky
Now!

Butters
No! 

Cartman
Jesus Christ! 

Butters
AAAAH!

Cartman
AAAAH! 

Frans
Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! 

Stan
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?

Murderin' Murphy
Yeah.

Stan
He done killed yer pahr.

Murderin' Murphy
What?! Well I'll rip his head off! 

Officer 2
We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! 

Frans
They are coming in! 

Mr. Garrison
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Officer 3
Whoa, no, no!

Officer 2
Hostages are secure at the park entrance!

Murderin' Murphy
I got you now, Pioneer Paul!

Pioneer Paul
They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! 

Police Chief
Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! 

Woman
Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!

Officer 2
Stop right now! It's over! 

PA System
Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day.  Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.

Pioneer Paul
We made it!

Murderin' Murphy
We made it! 

Woman 2
Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.

Murderin' Murphy
Whoa, that was great! 

Pioneer Paul
Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!

Gunsmith
Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!

Murderin' Murphy
Yeah, that'd be great!

Man 1
All right!

Man 2
Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.

Man 3
Let's go, huh.

Wendy
Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.

Stan
I know.

Police Chief
Come on you!

Frans
You're hurting my arm!

Police Chief
Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?

Frans
In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.

Police Chief
That's true. 

Wendy
Hey look. 

Butters
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 

Announcer
Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing.  Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums.  The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. 

Cartman
No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!

Liane
Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?

Cartman
They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!

Liane
Sweetiekins, are you all right?

Cartman
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.

Liane
No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.

Cartman
They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.

Cartman
All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?

Kyle
I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 

Stan
Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?

Kyle
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 

Kenny
(Damn.)

Stan
Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.

Kyle
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.

Stan
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.

Kyle
Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!

Stan
There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.

Kyle
Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!

Stan
How?

Kyle
I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.

Stan
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.

Kyle
I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 

Stan
God damn it.

Butters
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-

Cartman
There you are, Butters!

Butters
Uhuh, Eric.

Cartman
Butters, I need your help.

Butters
Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.

Cartman
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!

Butters
The Chinese?

Cartman
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.

Butters
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.

Cartman
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!

Butters
Why are they gonna kill my parents?

Cartman
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?

Butters
I don't want my parents to die.

Cartman
So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!

Butters
Well sure.

Cartman
You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.

Butters
Yeah,  fuck 'em.

Kyle
No... No!  No...

Kyle
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!

Stan
Let's get out of here!

Kyle
We can't just leave!

Stan
Come on!

Kyle
Aw it's horrible! 

Stan
Oh God!

Kyle
Somebody do something!

Clyde
Why are they doing this?!

Kyle
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 

Stan
I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 

Kyle
Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!

Stan
COME ON LET'S GO! 

Kyle
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!

Stan
JUST RUN!! 

Clyde
Oh God, what have they done?!

Stan
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!

Clyde
Whyyy? Whyyy?? 

Jimmy
We can't help him now.

Butters
Well I thought it was pretty good.

Stan
Let's just go, Let's just go! 

Kyle
NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...

Cartman
All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?

Butters
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.

Cartman
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 

Butters
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?

Cartman
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say herro and prease a lot.  Oh, herro prease. Ping pong ching chong.

Butters
Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.

Greeter
Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. 

Butters
Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.

Cartman
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

Butters
What?

Cartman
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!

Greeter
Uh, can I help you?

Cartman
Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.

Butters
Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.

Greeter
Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here?  Your waitress will be right with you.

Cartman
Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?

Butters
Yeah.

Cartman
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.

Butters
Stay calm, Eric.

Cartman
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.

Butters
Herro, prease.

Cartman
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.

Butters
Fing fong ting tong.

Cartman
Ting ton teetong.

Mother
What are they doing?

Father
I don't know.

Cartman
Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 

Stan
Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.

Jimmy
And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.

Stan
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.

Jimmy
I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan.

Stan
I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 

Jimmy
You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.

Stan
Indiana Jones! All right! 

Indy
Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure?

Stan
You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!

Spielberg
Well well hello there Indiana. 

Lucas
You're looking cute. 

Stan
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 

Spielberg
Oh yeah! 

Indy
No! 

Stan
Indy! 

Lucas
Yeah! Get down! Get back down! 

Spielberg
Hold him, Lucas! Come on!

Lucas
Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere!

Spielberg
Yeah!

Stan
No, stop! Raape!

Indy
HOOOOOOOOO! 

Cartman
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!

Butters
Okay, okay.

Cartman
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.

Butters
Huh, invasion pran.

Cartman
What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 

Father
'Scuse me, miss?

Greeter
Yes sir?

Father
These people won't leave us alone.

Cartman
...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.

Father
You aren't Chinese.

Cartman
Oh my God...

Butters
We're busted! Uh what do we do??

Greeter
Okay, why don't we go...

Cartman
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 

Butters
A gun?

Cartman
Hold the gun on them Butters!

Butters
I don't want a gun, Eric!

Cartman
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!

Butters
Oh jeez...

Cartman
Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!

Patron
This is stupid. I'm leaving!

Cartman
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!

Patron
Screw you!

Cartman
Shoot him, Butters!

Butters
No!

Cartman
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!

Butters
Waah! 

Patron
Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!

Cartman
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.

Butters
Huh?

Cartman
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.

Butters
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-

Cartman
It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.

Kyle
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.

DA
You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.

Kyle
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.

Stan
You aren't alone. 

Kyle
Stan?

Stan
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.

Kyle
I love you too.

DA
Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.

Stan
Wh-why?

DA
You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.

Kyle
Did you see it?

DA
Yes I saw it, but I-  But I just try not to think about it.

Stan
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!

DA
I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-

Kyle
Indy deserved more than that!

DA
GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!  No, no... 

Spielberg
Well well, Indiana Jones.  You're looking nice. 

Indy
Hey. Hey! 

Spielberg
There you go, Lucas! Dick him!  He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie!

Lucas
Grab his hands, heh. 

DA
Hey leave him alone! 

Spielberg
COME ON BIG GUY!

Indy
NOOO! 

DA
Nooo... Nohoho...  Waaait!  Wait I... want to help! 

Father
Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.

Cartman
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 

Captain
You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.

Cartman
No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

Butters
Uhwhat?

Cartman
One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!

Officer
The President?

Captain
All right men, come on. We're going in.

Cartman
No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 

Chinese Officer
Ow! Ah, o-ow! 

Cartman
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!

Butters
What? What happened? 

Cartman
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!

Butters
Aw, I did it again?

Cartman
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!

Butters
Well okay, I'm sorry!

Cartman
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!

DA
It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.

Det. Yates
Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!

Stan
But they raped Indiana Jones!

Kyle
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.

Det. Yates
I didn't see it. 

Jimmy
...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?

Det. Yates
No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch?  Mitch? Mitch? 

Spielberg
Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods?  Now let's see you just drop them pants!

Indy
Drop?

Spielberg
Just take 'em right off.

Indy
Uh what do you guys want?

Lucas
Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too. 

Spielberg
Them panties. Take 'em off.  There, boy! I bet you can squeal! I bet you can squeal like a pig!  Come on, squeal. Squeal now. Squ-squeal!  Weeee! Squeal.

Indy
We-eee!

Spielberg
Squeal louder. Weeee!

Indy
Weee!

Spielberg
Louder louder! Weeee!

Indy
Weee!

Spielberg
Louder! Get down there boy!  Get them britches down.

Indy
No...

Spielberg
Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!

Indy
Weee!

Spielberg
Weeeeee!  Weeee!

Indy
Hawwww! Hawwww! 

Kyle
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 

Cartman
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!

Butters
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.

Cartman
Good! Did you kill him? 

Butters
Uh, not exactly.

SWAT Officer
Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. 

Butters
Well it's not where I aimed, honest.

Cartman
Dude...

Butters
I seriously didn't mean it.

Cartman
Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 

Butters
What? Uh where are you going, Eric?

Cartman
You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.

Butters
By, by my, by myself?

Cartman
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.

Captain
Go inside! Move! 

Deputy 1
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest!  Break it in! 

Deputy 2
My God. 

Spielberg
Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?!  You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!

Lucas
Hm this is bullshit!

Stormtrooper
Weeee! Weeee!

Det. Yates
Boys, we got 'em.

Kyle
What?

Det. Yates
Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.

Mitch
And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet.  They'll never be free to do this again. 

Stan
So, what now?

Jimmy
Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?

Clyde
What do we do?

Kyle
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.

Captain
Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.

Father
There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!

Captain
We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-

Officer 1
Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.

Captain
Got who?

Officer 1
Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. 

Captain
Hohhh, they got them.

Officer 2
They got 'em. It's over.

Officer 3
It's over. 

Father
That means... they'll never be free to rape again.

Waiter
It's over its over. 

Officer 4
I love you.

Officer 5
I love you too. 

Butters
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?

Cartman
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 

Butters
...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 

Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? 

Wendy
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 

Cartman
She said it again. 

Wendy
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!

Cartman
Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?

Mr. Garrison
Eric, for the love of Jesus...

Wendy
This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!

Cartman
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!

Butters
I don't wanna get killed by boobs.

Wendy
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!

Mr. Garrison
Eric, stop being offensive.

Cartman
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.

Wendy
No you aren't!

Cartman
Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!

Cartman
Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous! 

Wendy
What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!

Cartman
Not at all.  Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!

Wendy
You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!

Cartman
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?

Wendy
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!

Cartman
Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?

Wendy
That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!

Cartman
You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.

Wendy
You think you're tough?

Cartman
Whassup?  Whassup?

Wendy
I'll smack the shit out of you!

Cartman
Standing right here, let's go, bitch.

Wendy
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!

Cartman
You're gonna fight me after school?

Wendy
That's right!

Cartman
You're a chick, dude.

Wendy
As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.

Cartman
Oh, it's on, bitch!

Wendy
You're gonna  fucking die! 

Butters
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!

Stan
What?

Bebe
Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!

Girls
Really? Wow.

Ike
Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. 

Kindergartners
Yaaay!

Red
Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. 

Pete
Did she just call us emos?

Butters
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.

Token
She is pissed off.

Cartman
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.

Clyde
Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.

Cartman
Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 

Jimmy
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.

Butters
Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 

Cartman
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?

Wendy
What?!

Cartman
Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-

Wendy
What?

Cartman
I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.

Wendy
If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!

Cartman
Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.

Wendy
No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!

Cartman
Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.

Wendy
Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!

Cartman
Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.

Wendy
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!

Cartman
Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.

Wendy
Get away from me! 

Michael
So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.

Stan
I guess so.

Pete
And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 

Michael
Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.

Stan
What am I supposed to do about it? 

Craig
Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.

Jimmy
I'll bet she is!

Butters
Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 

Cartman
Wendy. Wendy psst.

Wendy
What?!

Cartman
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.

Wendy
You really think that's gonna work on me?!

Cartman
Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-

Wendy
You can't bribe your way out of this!

Cartman
Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.

Wendy
No you don't.

Cartman
My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.

Wendy
You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!

Cartman
Eat my underwear?

Wendy
That's right.

Cartman
Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.

Wendy
Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!

Cartman
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.

Wendy
You fucking suck so hard!!

Cartman
I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.

Wendy
What are you doing?! 

Cartman
I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 

Wendy
Ew! 

Cartman
Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.

Wendy
Oh my God!

Cartman
So...  are we cool?

Wendy
No!

Cartman
I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-

Wendy
You are so pathetic!

Cartman
Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?

Cartman
Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.

Stan
What?

Cartman
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.

Stan
Yeah?

Cartman
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.

Stan
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 

Cartman
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.

Stan
Really?

Cartman
You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone. But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.

Stan
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.

Cartman
God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 

Mr. Garrison
And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... 

Bebe
Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!

Jimmy
As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 

Butters
Almost time. 

Mr. Garrison
And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.

Clyde
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.

Cartman
Detention! That's it! 

Mr. Garrison
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?

Cartman
Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 

Butters
Huh.

Mr. Mackey
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 

Cartman
Ahhh, sweet.

Butters
Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.

Cartman
What?! That's ridiculous!

Butters
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.

Cartman
That's not why I did it.

Craig
Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?

Cartman
Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.

Butters
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!

Cartman
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.

Craig
Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.

Jimmy
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.

Cartman
Huh?

Butters
That way it won't matter if you get detention.

Mr. Mackey
Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!

Jimmy
Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! 

Wendy
Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! 

Mrs. Testaburger
Wendy?

Wendy
Yeah?

Mrs. Testaburger
We need to talk to you, right now.  Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?

Wendy
What? No!

Mrs. Testaburger
Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? 

Mr. Testaburger
Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!

Wendy
You don't understand. He said horrible things.

Cartman
The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 

Mrs. Testaburger
Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?

Cartman
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 

Mrs. Testaburger
Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!

Wendy
Mom, you don't-

Mrs. Testaburger
Now, young lady.

Wendy
I'm not going to hurt you.

Mr. Testaburger
If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!

Wendy
Yes sir.

Mr. Testaburger
We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.

Liane
Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 

Mr. Testaburger
It won't happen again.

Liane
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 

Cartman
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.

Butters
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.

Cartman
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.

Bebe
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?

An Older Girl
Here she comes! 

Cartman
What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.

Wendy
You know I can't fight you!

Cartman
Why not? You chicken? 

Wendy
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!

Cartman
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!

Butters
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!

Cartman
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.

Bebe
Come on Wendy, kick his ass!

Wendy
I can't!  God damn it!

Butters
She chickened out!

Other students
Aw man. 

Cartman
Told you guys.

Stan
Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.

Pete
Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.

Jimmy
I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.

Clyde
And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 

Mr. Garrison
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 

Cartman
Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 

Wendy
You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.

Cartman
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?

Mr. Garrison
Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!

Wendy
Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!

Cartman
Wendy, Wendy.

Principal Victoria
Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.

Wendy
God! 

Principal Victoria
Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.

Wendy
No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.

Principal Victoria
Oh no? Are you sure?

Wendy
Yes ma'am!

Principal Victoria
I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?

Wendy
Ma'am?

Principal Victoria
I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to fight it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.

Wendy
My... parents said that if I fight-

Principal Victoria
And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?

Wendy
Yes ma'am!

Principal Victoria
When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!

Bebe
She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!

Millie
What? 

Cartman
Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!

Butters
She's coming! She's coming!

Cartman
Butters, get out of here!

Butters
But Wendy's coming to fight you.

Cartman
...Huh? 

Clyde
Oh boy here we go!

Butters
All right! 

Pete
It's about freaking time. 

Craig
All right, let's DO IT!

Cartman
What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.

Wendy
I don't care! 

Cartman
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.

A Girl
Shut up and fight! 

Cartman
All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!

Kids
Ohhhhh!

Butters
Fuck him up, Wendy!

Mr. Mackey
Wendy?

Wendy
I'm finished! 

Mr. Mackey
Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! 

Cartman
You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 

Stan
Dude, we never thought you were cool.

Cartman
That's not true. You're just saying that.

Kyle
No, really. We've always thought you suck.

Jimmy
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.

Cartman
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.

Craig
No, it's true. We've always hated you.

Butters
Well yeah.

Cartman
Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 

Craig
What?

Cartman
If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 

Kyle
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?

Kenny
(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)

Cartman
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?

Kenny
('Cause girls like shaved balls.)

Kyle
Girls like shaved balls?

Kenny
(Yes they do.)

Cartman
What girl is gonna see your balls?

Kenny
(Well I don't know.) 

Stan
Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 

Cartman
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.

Stan
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!

Kyle
I think Kenny likes it. 

Stan
I gotta get home for dinner.

Cartman
Yeah, me too. 

Stan
God!

Cartman
Shut up already!

Stan
I'm outta here; see ya guys. 

TV
Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London!  London has something for everyone! Sights!  Theater, and wonderful street performers! 

Stan
They're in London too?

Sharon
Hey, time for dinner guys. 

Sharon
All right kids, dig in.

Stan
Where's dad?

Sharon
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.

Stan
Why?

Sharon
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.

Randy
All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 

Sharon
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.

Randy
There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?

Shelly
Turn it off, Dad!

Randy
Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 

Stan
Oh Jesus Christ! 

Randy
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 

Cartman
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 

Stan
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.

Cartman
So?

Stan
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?

Cartman
How much?

Stan
Over two hundred bucks.

Kyle
Two hundred dollars?

Cartman
Really? Are you sure?

Stan
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 

Kyle
...Become a Peruvian flute band?

Stan
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.

Cartman
Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.

Stan
Yeah!

Kenny
(Woohoo!)

Kyle
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 

Cartman
Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?

Craig
...Fine.

Cartman
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?

Craig
...Yeah.

Stan
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 

Cartman
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.

Craig
What do you guys want?

Kyle
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!

Cartman
All right Craig! 

Craig
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?

Stan
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.

Cartman
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.

Craig
You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.

Cartman
Craig, don't be an asshole.

Craig
I'll go get the money. 

Stan
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!

Cartman
And a one, and a two, and a- 

Man 1
Wow, that's such cultural music.

Man 2
Very cultural, yes.

Cartman
Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 

Kyle
Gracias.

Woman 1
How cultural. 

Kyle
This is awesome!

Stan
Ya see, Craig? 

Cartman
Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 

Stan
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 

Cartman
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!

Stan
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 

Kyle

Come on, guys.

Michael Chertoff
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.  The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?

Chief Aide
France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake:  this is a pan flute epidemic.

Senator 1
A pan-demic?

Michael Chertoff
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.

Senator 2
Excuse me, but... aid other countries?

Michael Chertoff
Senator?

Senator 2
With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!

Michael Chertoff
You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?!  As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.

Paratrooper
Go, go! 

Cartman
Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 

Soldier 1
One more over here! 

Soldier 2
Let's go! Get 'em out!

Soldier 3
Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!

Stan
Hey, back off!

Soldier 3
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! 

Randy
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?

Sharon
The news.

Randy
Huh?

Sharon
We're watching the news.

Randy
That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 

Anchorman Tom
The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.  In cities all over the world  flute bands have been removed and quarantined.  But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that  if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs.  The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami.

Stan
Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?

Kyle
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?

Guard
Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!

Stan
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-

Guard
I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!

A Musician
Señor? Comprar CD la musica? 

Kenny
(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)

Craig
Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole. 

Michael Chertoff
Attention Peruvian flute bands:

Kyle
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!

Stan
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.

Sharon
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?

Mrs. Tucker
No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.

Mr. Tucker
You've checked with the police?

Gerald
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!

Sharon
None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!

Randy
Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.

Sharon
Well then stop being an idiot and help!

Mr. Tucker
Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?

Gerald
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.

Sheila
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.

Mrs. Tucker
What is that supposed to mean?

Sharon
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.

Mrs. Tucker
Now wait just a minute!

Sharon
I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-

Mr. Tucker
Like every kid doesn't have some problems!

Sheila
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.

Mrs. Tucker
Oh my God!

Mr. Tucker
This is ridiculous!

Randy
Ohhh this is good!

Gerald
That's not ridicul-

Soldier 4
Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all! 

Michael Chertoff
Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!

Official 1
We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.

Michael Chertoff
Well think about it, idiot! Where else would Peruvian flute bands come from? 

Official 1
Hmm...

Michael Chertoff
The country is in the name!

Official 2
No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.

Michael Chertoff
Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here! 

Official 3
Peh-roo.

Michael Chertoff
Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!

Official 1
Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.

Soldier 2
Yeah.

Michael Chertoff
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!

Chief Aide
Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.

Michael Chertoff
See?  God damn it! 

Michael Chertoff
The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.

Stan
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.

Michael Chertoff
Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.

Stan
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.

Kyle
We just wanna go home.

Kenny
(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)

Michael Chertoff
Which tourist location were they playing at?

Chief Aide
An outdoor mall in Colorado.

Kyle
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.

Stan
We we speak English!

Cartman
And we're White.

Michael Chertoff
Let me talk to you guys out here.  Well what do you think?

Chief Aide
I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.

Michael Chertoff
I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.

Official 1
A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?

Chief Aide
Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?

Michael Chertoff
Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had. 

Official 1
Sir?

Michael Chertoff
If they are the hybrid we're talking about,  then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.

Craig
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.

Cartman
You're being extremely negative, Craig. 

Michael Chertoff
All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.

Stan
Help you how?

Michael Chertoff
You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.

Craig
Can we please just go home, sir?

Michael Chertoff
We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.

Kyle
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 

Stan
Kyle, calm down.

Kyle
You know I can't go there, Stan!

Stan
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 

Michael Chertoff
You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.

Soldier 3
Thompson, can you come over here?  The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.

Musician 2
¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes!

Musician 3
Sí.

Other Musicians
Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores.

Thompson
They're saying something like, You can't send us away. We are the protectors.

Soldier 3
Protectors from what?

Musician 2
¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda!

Soldier 3
What does that mean?

Thompson
I think he said, the furry death?

Musician 2
La muerte peluda. ¡La muerte peluda!

Announcer
This is CNN.

Anchorman Tom
The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.

Paul Harris
Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the-  What the?! 

Woman 2
Oh my Gohhhd!

Woman 3
Ohmigod! 

Paul Harris
Jesus Christ! 

Shopper
AAAAHHH!! 

Paul Harris
There's, there's something else here, it's...  It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?! 

Anchorman Tom
Paul Paul, what do you see?

Paul Harris
It's furry! It's very furry! 

Anchorman Tom
Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say furry?  Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh-  My God what is that thing?!  AAAHHH!! 

Pilot
All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics. 

Craig
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said Hey, you know? This plan might backfire.  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.

Kyle
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?

Stan
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.

Craig
I'm being a dick?

Stan
Yes!

Craig
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?

Cartman
There's no talking to this guy.

Stan
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?

Craig
That would be great. Thank you.

Kyle
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?

Kenny
(Because they're trying to take over the world?)

Kyle
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.

Sharon
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!

Randy
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.

Sharon
I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 

Randy
What the hell was that? 

Sharon
Oh my God.

Randy
Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 

Shelly
What's going on, Dad? 

Randy
Get back to your room, Shelly! 

Randy
What's going on?

Mr. Garrison
They're all over the place!

Randy
What are?!

Mr. Garrison
They're really furry! 

Randy
What did that?!  What is that thing?! 

Officer Barbrady
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 

Linda
AAAAAAAAH!! 

Randy
Oh my Gohhhd!

Stephen
Go go go go back the other way! 

Randy
Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.

A Woman
Oh my Gohhhd! 

Randy
HAAA! 

Chief Aide
Sir? We've got a bigger problem.

Michael Chertoff
Oh? And what might that be?

Chief Aide
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be... 

Michael Chertoff
Guinea pigs?

Chief Aide
Yes sir. How did you know?

Michael Chertoff
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?

Davis
Sir?

Michael Chertoff
I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.

Davis
You... You... knew this was going to happen.

Michael Chertoff
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.  Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. 

Shelly
What's going on, Dad? 

Officer Barbrady
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 

Randy
Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!

Craig
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 

Stan
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!

Kyle
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?

Cpt. Taylor
I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.

Cpt. Gabriel
This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?

Cpt. Taylor
I'm trying. 

A Voice
This is Connor in Washington.

Cpt. Taylor
Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.

Carter
Jesus they're everywhere!

Cpt. Taylor
What are everywhere?

Carter
...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.

Stan
Guinea pigs?

Carter
Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. 

Randy
I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.

Sharon
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.

Randy
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.

Sharon
We have to see what the news is saying. 

Reporter
This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.

Sharon
Guinea pigs?

Reporter
Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.

Randy
Jesus, this thing is worldwide? 

Sharon
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 

Randy
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!

Sharon
Go Randy, run! 

Randy
Gotta get out!

Cpt. Taylor
Michaels, Harrison, anybody?  Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge.

Stan
Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.

Cpt. Taylor
...Yes, that was the order.

Kyle
And that makes sense to you?

Cpt. Taylor
Nope, not at all.

Cpt. Gabriel
Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.

Stan
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!

Cpt. Taylor
You don't understand, the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace.

Craig
Oh, that's awesome.

Kyle
So we've gotta find another way out of here.

Cpt. Taylor
It's starting to look that way, yeah.

Craig
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.

Cartman
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.

Kenny
(Yeah!)

Cartman
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.

Cpt. Gabriel
Luck at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. 

Top Official
More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here. 

Michael Chertoff
What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?

Official 1
...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.

Michael Chertoff
Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!

Official 2
No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.

Michael Chertoff
That was an order!  The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!

Soldier 4
Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. 

Randy
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!

Sharon
Where do we go, Randy?

Randy
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 

Man
Geow, my arm! MY ARM! 

Randy
Oh Jesus!

Sharon
Randy, run! 

Randy
Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!

Shelly
Dad! 

Randy
In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?

Sharon
Randy, put down that c-! 

Shelly
It's gonna kill us!

Sharon
Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 

Randy
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 

Sharon
Randy? Where are you going? 

Randy
Here we see a view from outside the bus.

Sharon
Randy!  What the hell are you doing?

Randy
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 

Cpt. Gabriel
I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.

Cpt. Taylor
This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.  Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?

Cpt. Gabriel
Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.

Cpt. Taylor
Oh my God.

Stan
Dude, what is this place?

Cpt. Taylor
It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.

Craig
That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.

Stan
Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!

Kyle
Yeah. Stuff just happens.

Craig
Stuff just happens.

Kyle
That's right!

Craig
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.

Cartman
That's right.

Craig
You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.

Cpt. Taylor
Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.

Kenny
(Hey, look out!) 

Cpt. Taylor
Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!

Randy
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.

Butters
Hello, heh.

Linda
What is that? Chris, what is that?

Randy
That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 

Stephen
Oh God look!

Sharon
Those aren't guinea pigs.

Stephen
Get off the roof! 

Randy
Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 

An Anchorman
And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.

Randy
Oh no! Oho oho. 

Townsman
Get away, there's bees everywhere!  There's another one right there!  

Townsman 2
It stung me! It stung me! 

Randy
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!

Kyle
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.

Cartman
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 

Kenny
(I think we're fucked!)

Kyle
Hey, hey, look at this. 

Cartman
What is it?

Kyle
I don't know. It's old.

Stan
Let's see what's in there.

Craig
Let's see what's in there. That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say Let's see what's in there.

Stan
It might be a way out, Craig!

Cartman
Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 

Kyle
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries

Kenny
(Yeah. Totally.)

Stan
You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 

Kyle
Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.

Stan
I know, a-and look. 

Cartman
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?

Kyle
Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 

Stan
And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 

Cartman
Dude, it's Craig!

Craig
What?

Kyle
That is Craig. 

Stan
Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?

Craig
I have no idea.

Cartman
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?

Craig
I don't know.

Top Official
There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.

It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control.

Am I in charge or not?! 

Randy
We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.

Sharon
Can we get out through the highway?

Soldier 5
The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.

Mr. Garrison
Guinea rats?

Randy
I'm so startled.

Mr. Garrison
What do you mean guinea rats?

Soldier 5
Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.

Sharon
Randy, will you stop doing that?! 

Stephen
Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city.

Mr. Garrison
In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.

Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?

It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah!

Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah!

Let's head over this way, guys.

Hear that? It sounds like water.

Cartman
Yeah, it's coming from up there.

Stan
Wow. 

Cartman
Dude, that's awesome.

Stan
All right, let's go. 

Craig
No.

Stan
Wait, whattaya mean no?

Craig
I'm not following you guys any more.

Stan
Dude, we we have to go check this out.

Craig
Why?

Stan
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.

Craig
Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because that's just the way it is.

Stan
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!

Craig
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.

Kyle
How do you do that?

Craig
It's easy. Watch. 

Stan
Craig, dude, wait up.

Cartman
Dude, Craig, we should go back now.

Craig
No.

Stan
Hey look, there's something here.

Craig
...Nope.

Cartman
Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.

Craig
Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.

Randy
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say hey guys.

Shelly
What is that? What is that? 

Randy
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 

Randy
What is it?

Husband
It's a Guineasaurus Rex! 

Shelly
Oh my Gohhhd!

Oh no, I'm way too startled!

Sharon
Look!

Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?

Sharon
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!

Randy
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 

Michael Chertoff
Wait here a minute.  Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this! 

Soldier 6
What's he doing?

Michael Chertoff
What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  Craiiig!  No! How did you get here?!

Cartman
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!

Soldier 6
Sir, ih-is everything all right?

Michael Chertoff
Shoot them!

Soldier 7
Shoot them?

Michael Chertoff
They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.

Stan
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.

Michael Chertoff
I said shoot them!

Kyle
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.

Top Official
Maybe we should look at it, sir.

Michael Chertoff
Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!

Craig
I didn't say anything.

Michael Chertoff
You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain! 

Top Official
You're, you're some kind of monster.

Michael Chertoff
Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil!  Arrrgh.

Top Official
Guinea pirate! 

Stan
Jesus Christ!

Craig
Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? 

Michael Chertoff
Dargh, no!

Craig
Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.

Michael Chertoff
Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh. 

Craig
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.

Randy
Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 

Craig
The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 

Cartman
That guy's an asshole!

Kyle
Yeah, what a dick!

Kenny
(I fuckin' hate Craig!)

Top Official 2
Sir! Sir, we have a problem!

New Director
What now?!

Top Official 2
The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.

New Director
My God, are you telling me..?

Top Official 2
Yes sir. It broke out of prison. 

Obama
If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. 

Randy
Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!

Gerald
Yyeeaahh!!!!

Obama
It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.

Randy
Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!

Obama
Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him Sparkles.

Randy
He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!

Obama
Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.

Supporters
Yes we can!

Randy
Yes I can! Yes I can! 

Randy
Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 

Mr. Harris
Did you see? Our man is in! 

Mrs. Harris
We did it!

Mr. Adler
Everything is going to be awesome now!

Randy
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!

Linda Black
I don't even know what to do now.

Randy
I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!

Crowd
Looosers! Looosers!

Stephen
Oh, shut up!

Crowd
Looosers!

Butters
We lost?

McCain
It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.

Supporters
No no! Noo nooo!

Butters
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.

Stephen
No. No, this can't happen! No! 

Linda
Stephen!

Stephen
It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.

Linda
You don't know that, Stephen!

Mr. Mackey
With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!

Mr. Garrison
We'll probably be dead by sunrise!

Stephen
Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... 

Randy
WOOOO Obama!

Mr. Garrison
Get out o'here!

Kyle
Dude, have you seen my parents? 

Stan
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?

Kyle
He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.

Reporter 1
Uh Mr. President, over here!

Reporter 2
Congratulations!

Reporter 3
Great start, great job!

Reporter 4
Change!

Reporter 5
Great job, Mr. President!

Reporter 6
Great job, Obama!

Obama
Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest.  Senator McCain.

McCain
President Obama. 

McCain, Obama
Boom, baby!

Obama
Ohoh man that was perfect! 

McCain
I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.

Obama
You played it perfectly, there was no way.

McCain
It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.

Davis
Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?

McCain
Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.

Davis
Sure. Hard part's over, right?

McCain
Actually, the hard part's just starting.

Reveler 1
Yoohoo!

Reveler 2
Obama yeah, I can't believe it!

Randy
O ba ma! O ba ma!

Revelers
O ba ma! O ba ma!

Randy
Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 

Stan
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 

Crowd
Obama!

Randy
Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!

Crowd
OooooOOOOooo! 

Barbrady
Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!

Randy
BOOOO! 

Reveler
...party Obama!

Barbrady
Come on, time to go home.

Randy
What are you? A McCain voter?

Crowd
Yeah!

Randy
Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 

Crowd
Obama! Obama!

Randy
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 

Barbrady
Ey, put down my car! 

Revelers
Yes we can! 

Barbrady
No! No! Hey, stop it!

Stan
Jesus Christ...

Randy
O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 

Cartman
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 

Quincy
Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!

McCain
Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.

Neely
I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.

Obama
Always workin' the angles.

McCain
My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.

Quincy
So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? 

Obama
The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.

Davis
Two hundred ten?

McCain
Million.

Quincy
No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.

Obama
Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built.  The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system.  There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.

Davis
So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.

Obama
Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.

Quincy
Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. 

McCain
Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.

Neely, Davis
Boom, baby!

McCain
You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.

Quincy
So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.

McCain
And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.

Quincy
This all sounds very risky.

Obama
We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-

Neely
And we are.

Obama
-we won't get caught.

Kyle
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.

Stan
Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.

Kyle
What?!

Stan
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!

Kyle
Oh my God! 

Kyle
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.

Ike
Good-bye. 

Stan, Kyle
NOO!

Kyle
Ike?  Oh crap Ike?

Chief of Security
All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3.

SS Agent
Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem.

Chief of Security
What?

SS Agent
The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.

Chief of Security
Barack Obama? 

SS Agent 2
They're all, they're all right through here, sir.

Chief of Security
Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?

Obama
Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?

Chief of Security
Good, sir.

Obama
I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?

Chief of Security
Right now?

Obama
I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.

Chief of Security
Sure, right this way, Mr... President. 

Obama
I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?

Chief of Security
Yes sir. 

Obama
Thanks. 

Chief of Security
I got a hundred dollars. 

Obama
All right, McCain. I'm in.

McCain
Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel?

Obama
I'm already on it.  Boom baby.

Reveler 3
Yehhheheah!

Randy
Wooo, change.

Reveler 4
Change.

Reveler 5
Change.

Stan
Dad Dad, we have a problem.

Randy
Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.

Stan
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.

Randy
We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.

Stan
Dude, he's wasted.

Randy
Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! 

Randy's Boss
Oh, hello Marsh.

Randy
Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! 

Randy's Boss
Huh?

Randy
You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!

Stan
Dad, what are you doing?!

Randy
It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!

Randy's Boss
Hey, I voted for Obama.

Randy
Obama's not talkin' about you!

Kyle
Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 

Palin
I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. 

Reporter 1
Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?

Palin
Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but  Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me.  Hello?

McCain
Hello Sarah, it's McCain.

Palin
I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.

Obama
I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.

Palin
Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.

Obama
God she's awesome.

Palin
Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then.  Bloody idiots. 

McCain
All right, here we go. 

Guard 1
What's that noise?

Guard 2
It's okay, just some construction outside. 

Obama
Oh no.  McCain? We've got a problem. 

Kyle
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.

Stan
Hey, there's some people. 

Stephen
Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 

Supporter 1
You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!

Woman Supporter 1
Who are you to turn us away?!

Stephen
I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!

Kyle
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.

Stephen
I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!

Supporter 2
You're going to deny them too?

Supporter 1
For God's sake, man, they're children!  Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in!  Look at their little cheeks!

Stan
Let go of my face, asshole!

Stephen
All right, damn you! The children can come in!

Kyle
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!

Supporter 3
Okay, then I want their place.

Supporter 4
Me too.

Kyle
We NEED a ride to the hospital!

Supporter 1
THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!

Woman Supporter 2
Let us in now! 

Mr. Garrison
Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!

Supporter 5
Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! 

Chief of Security
Mr. Obama?  Sir?  All right, give me the keys. 

Obama
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

Chief of Security
Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?

Obama
Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?

Chief of Security
Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here.

Obama
My wife?

Michelle
Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?

Obama
Uh, c-c-come on in, darling.  Thank, thank you boys. 

Michelle
Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?

Obama
Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.

Michelle
What is it?  Barack, what is it?!

Obama
The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.

Michelle
You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?

McCain
Hi, Michelle.

Michelle
You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!

McCain
Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.

Michelle
On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!

Palin
Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.

Michelle
Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.

Obama
Did you catch that, Davis?

Davis
I'm on it.

Kyle
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 

Nurse
There, just take a seat over there.

Kyle
E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.

Nurse
Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?

Stan
Why does that matter?

Nurse
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. 

Kyle
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.

Nurse
You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.

Stan
So where's the other doctor? 

Randy
Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 

Michelle
I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?

Obama
Did you really not like pretending to be married?

Michelle
Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B.

Obama
Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.

Michelle
My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it.

Obama
All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum.  4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors.

Michelle
Go! 

Obama
4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew.  5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum.

Grandma Obama
I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch.

Obama
5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs.  5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. 

A Guard
Hey you! Stop!

Obama
Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.  5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.

Obama
All done. Thanks. 

All
Boom, baby!

Quincy
There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?

Obama
We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. 

Kyle
What the hell?  Ike?

Ike
Boom, baby.

Flight Attendant
Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez.

McCain
Thank you very much.

Quincy
Well friends, let us depart.

Obama
Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye.

Neely
Wha?

Obama
I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot.

McCain
B, you can't be serious.

Quincy
Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?

Obama
Could have been I didn't make that flight.  What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while.

Michelle
You're serious.

Obama
Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?

Michelle
Aww, what the fuck. 

McCain
I just looove happy endings.

Stephen
It's still here, ih... it's all still here.

Mr. Garrison
Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?

Stephen
No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.

Randy
Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!

Stan
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.

Randy
Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 

Cartman
Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 

Butters
Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.

Kyle
What's High School Musical 3?

Clyde
You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.

Stan
What's High School Musical 1 and 2?

Cartman
There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!

Jason
What's High School Musical 1 and... Dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!

Jimmy
Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?

Craig
Peru.

Bebe
And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.

Millie
Bridon Gueermo? Oh he's such a dream!

Red
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.

Wendy
That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 

Bebe
As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.

Girls' Table
That's what bein' friends is about.
(Oh ye-ah)
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one.

Cartman
What the hell are they doing?

Girls' Table
- Together as one -

Stan
I have no idea. 

Girls' Table
As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.

Cartman
Dude, girls are such fags. 

Kids
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

Boys
Boys... are special in their own way.

Girls
Girls... are special like a birthday.

Kids
We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!

Heidi
Here he comes. 

A Boy
I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way.

Stan
Who the hell is that?

Butters
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.

Bebe
He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.

Kids
Everyone is special in their own way

Bridon
Special in their own way!

Kids
Move to the beat and let your spirit out!

Bridon
Let it out! Party people!

Kids
As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.

Kyle
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?

Stan
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...

Singers
You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-

Cartman
This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 

Stan
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.

Kyle
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.

Cartman
Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.

Stan
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.

Kyle
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?

Kenny
(No way in hell I'm doing it.)

Stan
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 

Kyle
I swear

Kenny
(I swear too.)

Stan
Okay, good.

Cartman
Ehhhhhhh. 

Kyle
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.

Cartman
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.

Stan
But you didn't die?

Cartman
...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 

Mr. Garrison
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.

Wendy
East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 

Bebe
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.

Kyle
Aw man.

Class
Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat

Mr. Garrison
Oh, you kids. 

Class
Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.

Bridon
East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.

Wendy
We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 

Bridon, Wendy
Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.

Class
East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...

Cartman
God this sucks!

Jimmy
Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?

Stan
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.

Jimmy
M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-

Stan
Stop. 

Jimmy
All righty then.

Stan
Uh, Wendy?

Wendy
Hey Stan.

Stan
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.

Wendy
What?

Stan
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.

Wendy
Stan, that's ridiculous.

Stan
It is?

Wendy
I would never leave you for Bridon.

Stan
Really?

Wendy
No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 

Jimmy
There you go. Feel better, p-pal? 

Stan
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!

Kids
Awww. 

Stan
No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.

Kids
Awww. 

Butters
Awww jeez, you're no fun. 

Bebe
Hey Bridon.

Bridon
Hey.

Lola
Hi Bridon

Bridon
Hi.

Heidi, Millie
Hey Bridon.

Bridon
Hey.

Stan
Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.

Bridon
Huh?

Stan
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.

Bridon
They are?

Stan
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.

Bridon
I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.

Stan
You don't like doing it?

Bridon
It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.

Stan
Basketball?

Bridon
I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.

Stan
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!

Bridon
I can't.

Stan
Yes, you can. What's stopping you?

Bridon
It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.

Stan
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!

Bridon
Really?

Stan
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.

Bridon
You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 

Stan
Sweet.

Mrs. Gueermo
Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture.  All right dear, dinner's ready!

Mr. Gueermo
Okay, let's eat!

Bridon
Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.

Mr. Gueermo
Ooo, that sounds emotional!  What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.

Bridon
No, Dad, can we just talk?

Mr. Gueermo
If you can talk it, you can sing it.  You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-

Bridon
Dad, I want to join the basketball team. 

Mr. Gueermo
What did you say?

Bridon
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.

Mr. Gueermo
Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!

Bridon
But Dad, it's what I really want.

Mr. Gueermo
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!

Bridon
I know. That's kind of why I like it.

Mr. Gueermo
Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.

Bridon
It's my life, Dad!

Mr. Gueermo
Don't make me slap you!  I will slap your face so super hard...  I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!

Mrs. Gueermo
Maybe you should let him try it.

Mr. Gueermo
What did you say, woman?!

Mrs. Gueermo
You aren't being fair.

Mr. Gueermo
That's it! I'm gonna slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
No, please.

Mr. Gueermo
I slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
Ahh!

Mr. Gueermo
I slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
Ohh!

Mr. Gueermo
I slap slap slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
Dohh!

Mr. Gueermo
Slapping you slapping you silly 'cause you disrespected me.

Mrs. Gueermo
Ooohohoo.

Cartman
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.

Kyle
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.

Cartman
Fuck you, Kyle! 

Kids
And you know, we're together at school again.

Jimmy
School again.

Stan
Aww!

Kids
With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.

Cartman
Oh God, shut up!

Kids
Together at school again. What a special day.

Cartman
Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!

Kids
We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away.

Stan
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!

Bridon
Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.

Stan
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.

Mr. Garrett
Really?

Bridon
Look, I should be getting to class.

Mr. Garrett
Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department.

Stan
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.

Bridon
I don't know...

Mr. Garrett
Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team.

Stan
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!

Bridon
Okay.

Mr. Garrett
Aayy, that's great, Bridon.

Bridon
Thanks.

Jason
We might have a chance at winning now. 

Mr. Gueermo
Bridon! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!

Bridon
Dad, I was just messin' around.

Mr. Gueermo
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!

Mr. Garrett
Eh, your kid is really good at this.

Mr. Gueermo
Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! 

Mr. Garrett
Just... go easy on him, huh?

Mr. Gueermo
You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!

Mr. Garrett
If he wants to play ball, you should let him.

Mr. Gueermo
I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!

Mr. Garrett
He's just a kid.

Mr. Gueermo
You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. 

Bridon
Dad, stop!

Mr. Gueermo
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself  There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you-  Slap it, I'll slap it! 

Bridon
Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.

Mr. Gueermo
Shut up, Bridon! 

Mr. Mackey
Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?

Mr. Gueermo
Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?!  I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! 

Mr. Gueermo
You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?!  You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!

Bridon
You're hurting my arm.

Mr. Gueermo
Stupid-ass boy!

Stan
Ah, shit.

Cartman
Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.

Stan
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.

Kyle
What? Are you crazy?

Cartman
No way dude.

Kyle
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?

Kenny
(Yeah.)

Stan
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.

Scott
What's so bad about hanging out with me?

Cartman
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.

Scott
Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!

Cartman
Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson. 

Stan
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?

Kyle
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.

Kenny
(Yeah!)

Stan
That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids

Scott
Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.

Cartman
That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.

Mr. Gueermo
Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. 

Male CPS Agent
Mister... Gueermo?

Mr. Gueermo
What?

Male CPS Agent
We're from Child Protective Services.  There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?

Mr. Gueermo
What? Who the hell's been saying that?!

Female CPS Agent
We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.

Male CPS Agent
His name is Stan Marsh.

Mr. Gueermo
You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!

Male CPS Agent
Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.

Mr. Gueermo
Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! 

Male CPS Agent
Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly.  We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... 

Mr. Gueermo
Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?!  No, there's another one!

Female CPS Agent
Oh my God!

Mr. Gueermo
Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!  There's a slap for you!  Slap, slap, slap!  Yeah, there you go!  Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! 

Mrs. Gueermo
Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! 

Mr. Gueermo
Awww. I'm going slap-happy!  I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!  What are you looking at, Robertson? 

Bebe
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 

Butters
Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 

Clyde
Who's the male lead?

Butters
No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 

Wendy
Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.

Bridon
Yeah, great.

Stan
God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? 
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...

Mr. Gueermo
You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-

Mrs. Gueermo
Oh please. You have to do something.

Mr. Gueermo
What are you interrupting me for?!

Mrs. Gueermo
It's our son, he's- he's running away.

Mr. Gueermo
What?!  What's going on here, what's this all about?  What do you think you're doing?

Bridon
Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-

Mr. Gueermo
Nono! Sing it!

Bridon
No! I'm sick of singing!

Mr. Gueermo
Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days? 

Mrs. Gueermo
Kids these days.

Mr. Gueermo
Kids these days!  Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!

Bridon
Just let me go.

Mr. Gueermo
Go ahead. Make my day.  You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face!  Ow!  Oh my God, what was that?  Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad!  Ow. What the H is going on?! 

Kyle
Well, I had to see it to believe it!

Cartman
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.

Stan
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.

Kyle
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!

Kenny
(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)

Stan
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!

Kyle
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!

Stan
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!

Scott
'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-

Cartman
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.

Stan
Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.

Cartman
That's a low blow, Stan.

Mr. Mackey
Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.

Mr. Garrett
All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?

Bridon
I'm ready, coach.

Mr. Garrett
Give 'em hell! 

Mr. Mackey
Just a minute to go in the first quarter. 

Bebe
Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?

Bridon
I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.

Wendy
You gave it up?

Stan
That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball

Cartman
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.

Stan
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.

Boys
You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
True, girl, you know it's true,  that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.

Kyle
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 

Cartman
And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 

Boys
Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do.

Bebe
Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?

Bridon
Uhh, sure. 

Kyle
Do what you want, don't have restraint.

Cartman
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.

Kenny
(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)

Stan
Try to do what you wanna do!

Boys
Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' 

Stan
involves needing scissors and glue!

Scott
Hey guys. Hey guys! 

Stan
Huh? 

Kyle
Where did everybody go?

Scott
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.

Stan
But the girls like singing and dancing.

Scott
No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.

Stan
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in x = y + 1. Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.

Cartman
Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, now right-click on menu item Equate O and type in input y.

Kyle
Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 

Stan
No, I'm on the Japanese side.

Cartman
Oh, who just shot me? 

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.

Cartman
U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.

Butters
Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.

Stan
Dude, what?

Butters
There's vampires in the school!

Stan
What?

Butters
Vampires. I've seen them.

Stan
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!

Red
Not a cheat if you rank up.

Butters
Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!

Kyle
Butters, there's no such things as vampires.

Butters
But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.

Cartman
All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.

Butters
Really? Do you think that's best?

Cartman
Yeah, now get out of here.

Butters
All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 

Cartman
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!

Lead Vampire
Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.

Spiky Vampire
That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Totally badass.

Vampir
Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.

Spiky Vampire
Oh, that's cool.

Midnight Vampire
I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.

Vampir
You can't; it's too close to Vampir. 

Butters
12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.

Sparkly Vampire
You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like the sparkles I got?

Butters
Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.

Vampir
Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.

Spiky Vampire
Hehyeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.

Butters
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.

Bloodrayne
Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?

Other Vampires
Yeah! Cool!

Vampir
Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. 

Butters
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 

Tape
Toot toododoo!  It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu.  AAHHH.

Vampir
Ummm, what are you doing?

Butters
Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!

Bloodrayne
That kid was really scared of us.

Vampir
That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.

Spiky Vampire
Heeyeah, we're cool, huh? 

Pete
What the hell are those kids doing?

Henrietta
Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?

Pete
Are they trying to be Goth?

Michael
No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.

Henrietta
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.

Midnight Vampire
Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.

Vampir
Tommy Petros? Is he cool?

Bloodrayne
Yeah, he's cool enough.

Vampir
All right. 

Pete
So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?

Vampir
We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.

Michael
Aren't you Mike Makowski?

Vampir
That's Vampir Makowski now.

Henrietta
You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!

Sparkly Vampire
Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!

Pete
Really. Do you guys even smoke?

Vampir
Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.

Other Vamps
Yeah.

Pete
Oh my Gohhd.

Vampir
You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.

Pete
All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 

Butters
Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!

Linda
Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.

Butters
Oh no, what did I do this time?

Linda
You just march on in there.

Butters
Oh Jeez...

Stephen
You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!

Butters
I have no idea, sir.

Stephen
I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!

Butters
Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-

Stephen
What keeps a family together, Butters?!

Butters
A well-organized pantry.

Stephen
That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!

Butters
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-

Stephen
You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!

Butters
Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 

Vampir
...All mortals share a soft repose,
My soul doth dreadful vigils keep,
More keen than which hell scarcely knows.

Sparkly Vampire
What is that kid doing?

Butters
Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.

Vampir
So?

Butters
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!

Vampir
What?

Butters
Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.

Cowlick Vampire
You're not cool enough to be one of us.

Butters
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.

Vampir
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.

Butters
Yes! Yes, anything else?

Midnight Vampire
I want some Cheetos.

Butters
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.

Singer
I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...

Boy 1
Where did it go? Do you see where it went?

Boy 2
Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. 

Pete
What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!

Boy 1
Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?

Michael
So lame. So... Lame...

Henrietta
You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.

Michael
Sooo lame! 

Little Vamp
See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.

Shades Vamp
This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.

Henrietta
Get out of our space, you little twerps!

Pete
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?

Butters
I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.

Vampir
You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?

Butters
Yeah, I guess.

Vampir
Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.

Butters
Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.

Vampir
Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself. 

Butters
Whoa.

Vampir
And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done. 

Butters
Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 

Vampir
It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. 

Stephen
There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! 

Linda
Butters, what have you done to your hair? 

Stephen
Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! 

Butters
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!

Linda
What on Earth?

Stephen
That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!

Butters
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 

Stephen
All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!

Linda
Butters? 

Butters
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 

Principal Victoria
Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this vampire thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.

Pete
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.

Michael
We aren't vampires.

Principal Victoria
I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the in thing right now, but-

Pete
We aren't trying to be popular!

Principal Victoria
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 

Mr. Mackey
Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.

Vampir
Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?

Principal Victoria
I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-

Michael
We aren't friends!

Vampir
Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.

Michael
Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.

Pete
Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 

Pete
Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 

Boy 1
It went this way?

Boy 3
Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. 

Michael
So we're back to that, are we?

Firkle
Shit.

Pete
Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.

Butters
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 

Cartman
Butters?  Butters?! 

Butters
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!

Cartman
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!

Butters
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 

Cartman
Dude! 

Liane
You all right, sweetie?

Butters
U-huh.  Ow.

Liane
What's going on?

Cartman
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!

Liane
Oh dear.

Cartman
Yes.

Michael
I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.

Firkle
Jesus.

Pete
It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?

Michael
Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.

Henrietta
It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.

Pete
Whattaya mean?

Henrietta
I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.

Pete
Does your mom know you took her car?

Henrietta
Do I care?

Michael
All right, this is probably good enough.

Pete
Yeah, pull over here. 

Vampir
(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)

Michael
What should we do with him?

Pete
Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.

Vampir
(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)

Michael
What's that?

Vampir
(I'm not really a vampire.)

Michael
You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. 

Pete
If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.

Michael
How about we send him to Transylvania?

Pete
No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.

Henrietta
If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.

Goths
Scottsdale.

Linda
Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 

Stephen
Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!

Butters
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.

Stephen
Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?

Butters
Hey Dad. 

Stephen
AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!

Butters
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.

Stephen
All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!

Butters
Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!

Linda
Stephen, what has happened to our boy?

Stephen
He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.

Michael
I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.

Henrietta
He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.

Waitress
Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? 

Henrietta
Leave us alone!

Waitress
Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. 

Pete
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!

Waitress
Looks the same to me.

Pete
I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.

Waitress
No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. 

Henrietta
Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.

Pete
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.

Butters
Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.

Henrietta
Get away, douchebag.

Butters
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.

Pete
What are you talking about?

Butters
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 

Pete
Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?

Butters
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.

Michael
Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.

Pete
How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!

Henrietta
Well, I think we all know what has to be done.

Michael
Yup.

Pete
Let's get to it. 

Singer
Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.

Clerk
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

Pete
You should probably get out of here. 

Spiky Vamp
What the hell are they doing??

Butters
They're putting an end to it! 

Clerk
AAAAAAAAAAAAH! 

Butters
Mom, Dad!  I changed back!

Stephen
What?

Butters
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!

Linda
We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.

Stephen
That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.

Butters
What's that, Dad?

Stephen
Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!

Butters
Uh oh.

Stephen
Butters, you are grounded!

Butters
Ahh, dangit! 

Stephen
It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. 

Pete
Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's fun, enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 

Michael
Fuck all of you.

Character
Line
Cartman
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?

Stan
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.

Kyle
Yeah, it's just so astounding.

Cartman
Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.

Craig
Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.

Kyle
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.

Jimmy
Well, so, w-who is she?

Cartman
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.

Butters
Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!

Stan
What?

Butters
Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!

Stan
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.

Butters
Um, does Kenny like her?

Kyle
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.

Butters
Oh, no. Oh, geez!

Cartman
Butters, what's the problem?

Butters
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

Kyle
What?!

Butters
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!

Cartman
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!

Jimmy
Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.

Stan
All right, come on, guys. 

Butters
Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?

Girl 1
So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... 

Stan
Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! 

Kenny
(Oh, hi, guys.)

Stan
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.

Kenny
(What about her?)

Stan
Oh, boy.

Kyle
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...

Kenny
(But what?)

Kyle
W-well, we've heard that she's...

Cartman
Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.

Kenny
(Huh?)

Cartman
Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.

Kenny
(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 

Cartman
He took it pretty well.

Kenny
(Hey, Tammy!)

Tammy
Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?

Kenny
(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)

Tammy
TGI Friday's?

Kenny
(Yep. I like the food!)

Tammy
Yeah, okay. But...  Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true.  But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault!  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.

Kenny
(Jonas Brothers?)

Tammy
You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? 

Clerk
There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.

Kenny
(Thanks.) 

Cartman
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 

Kyle
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?

Kenny
(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)

Stan
A B.J.?

Kyle
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?

Kenny
(Of course, dude!)

Cartman
Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!

Stan
Yeah, dude, that's gross.

Kenny
(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)

Kyle
What kind of protection?

Kenny
(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)

Clerk 2
Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?

Kenny
(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)

Clerk 2
These here? Why, certainly. 

Kenny
(Cool!) 

Kyle
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?

Kenny
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)

Cartman
Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?

Kenny
(Yep! Woo-hoo!) 

Tammy
Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? 

Joe Jonas
I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!

Jonas Brothers
I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.

Joe
Bay-bay! I'm hot.

Nick Jonas
He's hot.

Little Girl
My 'giney tickles! 

Tammy
Oh, my God. It's that tingling again.  I love you! 

Joe
Tell me how was I to know?

Jonas Brothers
You'd take your love and go.

Joe
Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...

Jonas Brothers
To put my arm around you?

Joe
The seasons change.

Kevin Jonas
Bay-bay!

Joe
And the world goes round.

Nick
The world goes round and round and round.

Jonas Brothers
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal.

Joe
'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!

Nick
Love you, bay-bay!

Kevin
Bay-bay!

Tammy
Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww!  You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!

The Jonas Brothers
Good night, Denver. We love you all!  We love you, Denver!  Good night! 

Tammy
Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!

Kenny
(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 

Usher
And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.

Tammy
Huh?

Usher
Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. 

Tammy
They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!

Kenny
(Look, they're nothing, but...)

Tammy
It's a dream come true! 

Kenny
(Hey!)

Usher
All right, right this way, girls.

Roadie
Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you.  Uh, not you. 

Kenny
(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)

Roadie 2
The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. 

Girl in Puppy T-shirt
Why do you think they called us back here?

Fat Girl
They must've wanna have sex with us.

Tammy
What? You think so?

Fat Girl
Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.

Girl in Puppy T-shirt
Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!

Girl in O T-shirt
Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!

Tammy
Me neither. 

Jonas Brothers
Hey, there, girls! 

Joe
Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.

Nick
Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.

Fat Girl
Let's just get to the blowjobs.

Joe
Blow what?

Kevin
I don't know.  Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you

Nick
And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.

Tammy
Purity rings?

Joe
We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.

Kevin
And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.

Nick
That's just how we roll.

Kevin
Yeah.

Nick
Yeah. 

Joe
So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?

The Girls
Okay.

Kevin
And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.

Cartman
Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.

Stan
So how did it go last night? 

Kyle
What's that?

Kenny
(A purity ring.)

Cartman
Purity ring?

Kenny
(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)

Kyle
...Well, what does that mean?

Kenny
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)

Stan
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-

Kenny
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)

Kyle
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.

Kenny
(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 

Butters
Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.

Kyle
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.

Butters
Uh, what's that?

Stan
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.

Butters
Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 

Jonas Brothers
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!

Purity Boy 1
Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?

Purity Boy 2
You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?

Purity Boy 3
We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?

Nancy
Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?

Purity Boy 1
We look forward to it all week long. 

Purity Boy 3
Sure is sweet.

Purity Boy 1
It's the most fun I've had in weeks. 

Jonas Brothers
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay.

Director
Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.

Joe
This is bullpucky!

Kevin
Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!

Director
Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.

Joe
Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!

Kevin
Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.

Disney Exec 1
Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.

Joe
We don't care about the company.

Director
And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?

Kevin
We aren', we aren't afraid of him.

Disney Exec 2
Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.

Disney Exec 3
Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!

Kevin
Let's be strong, guys.

Disney Exec 3
Hello sir. How was your trip? 

Mickey
What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?

Director
Uh we'll just leave you alone. 

Mickey
So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?

Kevin
We... need to talk about something.

Mickey
Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.

Joe
Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.

Mickey
Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.

Joe
Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.

Mickey
The rings stay on!

Joe
Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. 

Mickey
You don't... Fucking..Talk to me. Like that, haha. You little... piece of... shit, Haha!  Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha.  Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.

Nick
No, sir.

Kevin
No, Mr. Mouse.

Joe
No, Mr. Mouse.

Mickey
Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha.  Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. 

Kyle
Yup, he's in here. 

Stan
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!

Kyle
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!

Kenny
(Look at this. More DVDs.) 

Cartman
Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!

Stan
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.

Cartman
Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?

Stan
You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?

Kenny
(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)

Stan
You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.

Kyle
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.

Cartman
Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!

Stan
What? 

Cartman
Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings. These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 

Kyle
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!

Stan
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 

Kyle
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 

Kenny
(Yeah...)

Announcer
Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.

Host
We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. 

Joe
Hello.

Host
Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.

Joe
Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.

Mickey
In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.

Kevin
Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. 

Host
Now, guys, a lot has been made about your purity rings. Can you tell us about those?

Joe
Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.

Mickey
Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. 

Host
That's wonderful, boys.  It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?

Nick
Uh huh.

Joe
Yeah. Uh huh.

Kevin
Yeah.

Nick
Yeah.

Host
Well can you give our audience a peek?  What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? 

Mickey
Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. 

Stan
Excuse us. Excuse us.

Girl 2
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!

Host
That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?

Cartman
Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!

Stan
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!

Joe
Huh?

Kyle
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!

Mickey
Who the hell are these guys?  Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?

Cartman
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 

Kyle
Cartman?

Mickey
You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! 

Stan
Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 

Kyle
Dow... 

Voice 1
Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!

Voice 2
Get another mic on that dronk kid.

Mickey
They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha?  Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha.  Who do you work for? DreamWorks?  Answer me, haha!

Stan
We... don't work for any-body.

Mickey
Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha.  You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.

Cartman
The hell did you do to us?!

Mickey
SHUT UP!  Haha.

Announcer
And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular!  Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! 

Male Host
Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!

Female Host
In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia.

Blonde Girl
Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?

Father
Not yet, Katie.

Male Host
Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.

Kenny
(And not getting a blowjob...)

Male Host
We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.

Mickey
You'd better start talkin', haha!  You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!

Stan
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.

Kyle
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.

Mickey
You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!

Joe
You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.

Kevin
We've all angered God.

Mickey
You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha!  You three faggots are going onstage, and  YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody  fuck this up!  Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?!  Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha.  They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha.  Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.

Audience
BOOO!!

Mickey
Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.

Joe
Come on guys. 

Mickey
No! Stop! Bring them back here!

Roadie
It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.

Mickey
NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! 

Father
That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.

Reporter
Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.

Mickey
Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.

Reporter
The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. 

Tammy
Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.

Kenny
(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)

Tammy
No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.

Kenny
(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)

Tammy
Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.

Kenny
(Yeah. Screw this crap!) 

Tammy
Oh I feel better already!

Kenny
(Me too!)

Tammy
What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?

Kenny
(Woo-hoo!!) 

Father Maxi
And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...

Cartman
I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.

Kyle
Well, now we know.

Cartman
And knowing is half the battle.

Cartman
The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 

Josh
Lisa I had a really great time tonight.

Lisa
I did too, Josh.

Josh
Would you... mind very much if kissed you?

Lisa
Not at all. 

The Coon
A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.

Lisa
O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!

The Coon
Let her go!

Josh
'Scuse me?

The Coon
You aren't raping anyone tonight!

Josh
Oh, it's a talking squirrel.  Oh!

Lisa
Ah!

Josh
Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!

The Coon
Get out of here! Get to safety! 

Josh
Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!

The Coon
Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?

Josh
Oh that really stings.

Officer 1
Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.

Sgt. Yates
Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- 

The Coon
Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.

Sgt. Yates
Oh, not this kid again.

Officer 1
Hey, you get out of here. Out.

The Coon
There was another rapist in the park tonight.  It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top.

Sgt. Yates
What?

The Coon
I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.

Sgt. Yates
Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop- 

Officer 1
He's gone.

The Coon
No, I'm just over here now.  What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?

Sgt. Yates
Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!

Officer 1
Jail's full, sir.

Sgt. Yates
Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- 

The Coon
Now I'm back over here.

Sgt. Yates
Just get out of here before we-! 

The Coon
I'm right here now. 

Sgt. Yates
All right, stop it!

The Coon
Yes, I have to go now.  But in the meantime I have something that might interest you.  Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!

Sgt. Yates
What's in here? 

Cartman
Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.

Stan
Who's the Coon?

Cartman
I know, right?  Who is the Coon? It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.

Kyle
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.

Cartman
You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!

Kyle
...Dude, what?!

Cartman
He's not a fag!

Kyle
Why do you care?

Cartman
Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term fag, Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?

Cartman
And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right? What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.

The Coon
Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city.  And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are-  Who the hell is that?  Who the hell are you?

M
I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.

The Coon
Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs!  Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!

M
Nuh uh.

The Coon
Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?

M
I am Mysterion.

The Coon
Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!

Mysterion
I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.

The Coon
Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.

Mysterion
I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.

The Coon
Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!

Mysterion
I really don't care who you are.

The Coon
Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!

Mysterion
Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?

The Coon
No, I'm no- I  I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!

Mysterion
I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 

The Coon
NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!

Cartman
Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.

The Coon
How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!

Maitre D
Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?

The Coon
Yes, it's fine!

Maitre D
Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.

The Coon
What do you mean continued? You don't know who I am!

Maitre D
Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?

The Coon
No, I'm not that kid!

Maitre D
Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.

The Coon
You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!

Cartman
Hunh!

Liane
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?

Cartman
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!

Liane
Aww, what happened, hun?

Cartman
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!

Anchor
Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.

Cartman
Wha, what?

Anchor
But who exactly is... Mysterion? 

Cartman
What?!

Anchor
Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado.  They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero.

Man 1
Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.

Woman 1
He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.

Man 2
To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!

Crowd
Yeah! 

Man 3
Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.

Cartman
Fuckin' butthole!

Man 4
Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!

Reporter
This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.

Cartman
You gotta be kidding me!

Reporter
As hundreds of people to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion? 

Anchor
If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.

Cartman
AAAAAHT!! 

Mysterion
I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 

Sgt. Yates
Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?

Mysterion
There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.

Officer 2
We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help.  Godspeed, Mysterion!

Sgt. Yates
You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! 

The Coon
Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!

Mysterion
This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-

Mysterion, the Coon
Answer the call to save her.

The Coon
That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!

Mysterion
I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!

Cartman
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!

Stan
Not really.

Cartman
Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 

Stan
Dude, what the hell?

Cartman
Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!

Stan
Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.

Clyde
Yeah, so do I.

Cartman
What?! Why?

Clyde
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.

Cartman
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!

Wendy
How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?

Cartman
Fucking bitch...

The Coon
I had no choice.  I was at the end of my rope.  Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.

A Voice
Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.

The Coon
Come out where I can see you!

A Voice
What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?

The Coon
I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.

A Voice
How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon  come to put a stop to me again.

The Coon
Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.  I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.

Professor Chaos
Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I  whoop.  But you see I also know you like to beat me up.

The Coon
I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. 

Professor Chaos
Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!

The Coon
I'm not on his side!

Professor Chaos
Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray!  Yeah-ha! 

The Coon
That's it! 

Professor Chaos
O- oh careful General Disarray.

The Coon
Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!

Professor Chaos
Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! 

The Coon
Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!

Professor Chaos
Let him go, General Disarray!  Why would you help us?!

The Coon
Because Mysterion is trying to  You fucker, that fuckin' hurt!  Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!

Professor Chaos
But you both fight for justice and good.

The Coon
Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!

Professor Chaos
Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-

The Coon
N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.

Professor Chaos
Weh- oh yeah. 

The Coon
I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.

Mysterion
Hello Kyle.

Kyle
Whoa, what the?

Mysterion
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.

Kyle
Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.

Mysterion
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.

Kyle
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.

Mysterion
I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.

Kyle
Who? Me? Why?

Mysterion
Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 

Professor Chaos
This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.

The Coon
You guys have your own storage facility?

Professor Chaos
Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it.  This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays.  And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second!  And here's some of our evil minions!  We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?

The Coon
I'll take a Sprite.

Professor Chaos
Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray.  As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.

The Coon
You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that Who Is The Coon? T-shirt I gave you?

Professor Chaos
Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.

The Coon
Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.

Professor Chaos
No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. 

The Coon
Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.

Anchor
The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion  does not reveal his identity.

Professor Chaos
Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital?  I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What?  Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha.  Jesus Christ.

Anchor
Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?

Anchor 2
Where is Mysterion?

Professor Chaos
Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?

The Coon
If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?

Professor Chaos
But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?

The Coon
Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.

General Disarray
You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital.

The Coon
You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?!  Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! 

Professor Chaos
Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended.  I mean, well I hate the world and all its beauty and happiness and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean.  Whoa. Oh hamburgers!

General Disarray
AAAGH! 

Professor Chaos
Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...

Mysterion
Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!

Professor Chaos
Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to 

Professor Chaos
Waaugh!

Man 5
What is that?

Man 6
Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!

Man 7
Give him hell, Mysterion! 

Woman 2
Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! 

Officer 3
Jesus Christ, we need backup out here! 

Officer 4
I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.

Sgt. Yates
You think your bullets can hurt him? 

Professor Chaos
Yeah, we did it!

Man 8
He's dead. Mysterion is dead.

Woman 3
Nooo... 

Reporter
The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?

Man 9
Wait! Look! 

Officer 4
He's all right! 

Cartman
Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!

The Coon
Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.

Man 10
Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?

Man 11
Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!

Professor Chaos
Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!

The Coon
Don't worry, Mysterion!  The Coon will now help you!

Professor Chaos
Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together.  Waaa.  Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. 

The Coon
That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.

Mysterion
What next time?

The Coon
Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. 

Mysterion
Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.

Sgt. Yates
Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante

The Coon
Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.

Man 12
Don't show your face, Mysterion!

Man 13
You have to be a symbol!

The Coon
So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!

Mysterion
No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 

Crowd
Ohhh.

Man 14
Well I'll be.

The Coon
I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!

Mr. Garrison
Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.

Sgt. Yates
Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. 

The Coon
My entire plan worked to perfection.  My work here is done.  With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe.  Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind.  Every town needs a hero.  Every town needs... a Coon. 

Stan
Do I really have to do this, Dad?

Randy
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.

Stan
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.

Teller
Okay, next please.

Randy
Go on, Stanley. 

Teller
How can I help you, young man?

Stan
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.

Teller
Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. 

Stan
Uh, what?

Teller
It's gone. It's all gone.

Stan
What's all gone?

Teller
The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.

Stan
What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.

Teller
Not anymore you don't. POOF.

Stan
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?

Teller
I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.

Stan
I just opened an account.

Teller
Do you have any money invested in this bank?

Stan
No, you just lost it all!

Teller
Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. 

Stan
Hey!

Teller
Hello Mrs. Farnicle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.

Elderly Woman
What?

Teller
Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.

Stan
Dad?!

Randy
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?

Teller
Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only please step aside. 

Announcer
This, is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL

Anchor
An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.

Mr. Garrison
It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.

Stephen
It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!

Butters
Hi, Grandma!

Darryl Weathers
First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!

Worker 1
They took our jobs!

Worker 2
Trk rrr jrrbs!

Worker 3
Tuck rjrrbs.

Worker 4
Turk rjrrrbs.

Anchor
Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment.  We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10.

Sharon
All right everyone, eat up. 

Randy
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!

Sharon
You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.

Stan
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?

Randy
I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 

Stan
Yeah, I think I get it.

Orator 1
And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy just-? As the people we must...

Orator 2
...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...

Cartman
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...

Randy
There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!

Man 1
He's right.

Man 2
This is the first guy to actually make sense. 

Randy
Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 

Clerk
Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?

Stan
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.

Clerk
Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.

Stan
What?

Clerk
I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?

Stan
So?

Clerk
Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.

Stan
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?

Clerk
Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 

Randy
We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!

Gerald
What can we do, Randy?

Man 3
Yes tell us.

Man 4
Tell us.

Man 5
Tell us what to do.

Man 6
Tell us, Randy, what we should do!

Man 7
What should we do, Randy?!

Randy
We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 

Al
Mornin' Ted.

Ted
Mornin' Al.

Kyle
Well this sucks!

Clyde
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.

Cartman
Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!

Kyle
You want something new every week, fatass.

Cartman
Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!

Kyle
My fault?

Cartman
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!

Kyle
Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!

Butters
Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?

Kyle
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?

Butters
Well Eric did. 

Cartman
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.

Kyle
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family

Man 8
We best speak with the Council, and tell them.. a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.

Receptionist
Can I help you?

Stan
I wanna return this Margaritaville.

Receptionist
O-kay, let me send you into Josh. 

Josh
Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?

Stan
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.

Josh
Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.

Stan
What?

Josh
Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.

Stan
Wall Street?

Josh
Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.

Stan
So?

Josh
Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... 

Stephen
The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.

Father Maxi
You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.

Randy
I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.

Skeeter
We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.

Randy
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.

Man 9
Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!

Randy
What?!

Man 9
He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!

Father Maxi
Spend more?! What mockery is this?!

Randy
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?

Cartman
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 

Kyle
What's that? 

Man 10
'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.

Kyle
What? 

Mr. Garrison
Now please, please! 

Man 10
You have sinned!

Mr. Garrison
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.

Kyle
What's going on?

Man 10
Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!

Kyle
What did he do?

Man 11
Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!

Man 10
Take that punishment, heathen! 

Kyle
Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!

Man 10
Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.

Kyle
Come on, this is ridiculous!

Man 10
What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!

Kyle
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 

Mr. Garrison
Oh. 

Stan
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?

Stockbroker
Margaritaville?

Stan
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.

Stockbroker
Oh, that makes sense.

Stan
It does?

Stockbroker
You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.

Stan
So I can return it to a bank?

Stockbroker
Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritavilles assets from the banks.

Stan
What?!

Stockbroker
Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works.  Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!

Stan
Aargh! 

Kyle
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.

Man 11
By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!

Randy
We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?

Stephen
Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.

Father Maxi
Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!

Randy
That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!

Man 12
Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.

Father Maxi
Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.

Skeeter
I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. 

Cartman
Did somebody say catch a Jew? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.

Treasurer 1
Uhh, how can we help you, young man?

Stan
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!

Treasurer 1
Ohhh that makes sense.

Stan
Nnnaaargh!

Treasurer 1
No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.

Stan
Really?  Thank you.

Treasurer 1
Be right back. 

Treasurer 2
Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.

Stan
What?!

Jimmy
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.

Kyle
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.

Butters
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!

Kyle
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 

Cartman
All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.

Kyle
Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.

Jimmy
Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.

Kyle
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 

Stan
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!

Treasurer 1
What, you think it's worth more?

Stan
No, dude, that doesn't make sense!

Treasurer 2
Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.

Treasurer 3
Uh oh, problem! Problem again!

Treasurer 2
What is it now?

Treasurer 3
Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!

Treasurer 1
Okay, no problem.  We'd better consult the chart. 

Treasurer 3
Sirs, another insurance company is going under!

Sir 1
Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. 

Treasurer 1
Bailout!

Treasurer 3
Most prudent move is a bailout!

Sir 1
Bail out the insurance company! 

Man 13
It's a miracle.

Man 14
Why would someone do this? 

Randy
What is this? What's going on?

Stephen
There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.

Randy
What's he doing?

Stephen
He's... paying for everyone's debts. 

Darryl Weathers
Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.

Randy
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?

Man 15
So that people will have money to spend.

Sheila
Kyle!  Kyle, you have to stop this! 

Kyle
It's okay, Ma.

Sheila
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 

Randy
Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.

Kyle
Heunh. 

Man 16
He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. 

Man 17
He's dead.

Dr. Doctor
No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. 

Anchor
For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn.  Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. 

Randy
Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom. Oh, we need this! 

Anchor
Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice.  Barack Obama. 

Kyle
Aww, come on!

Cartman
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.

Wendy
Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?

Stan
What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!

Wendy
What day?

Butters
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!

Clyde
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.

Red
Oh God, that show is so dumb.

Cartman
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!

Tweek
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!

Wendy
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!

Cartman
No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 

Little Girl
Eww! 

Kyle
Come on guys, we gotta go! 

Jimmy
We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.

Cartman
Let's get to my house!! 

Wendy
God they're so stupid!

Stan
Oh boy!

Butters
This is gonna be great!

Craig
I've been waiting for this all week.

Butters
Oh boy!

Cartman
Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.

Craig
Dude, I was here first.

Cartman
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 

Butters
Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!

Announcer
You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.

Announcer 2
Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat. 

Phillip
It wasn't me! 

Announcer 2
And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Terrance & Phillip: Blood Rage 

Announcer
...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!

Cartman
What?

Announcer 3
The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters. Katherine and Katie Queef.  Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out their vaginas.  It's The Queef Sisters special on Channel Canada.

Doctor
Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam.

Katie
Alright Doctor.

Katherine
I'm ready, Doctor.

Doctor
Now I'm just going to check for cysts.  Awww! 

Cartman
What the fuck is this?!

Doctor
Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!

Katherine
I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.

Katie
Huhuhuhu!

Doctor
Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts.  Arh!  Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there!  That's it! No PAP smear for you!

Katherine
But doctor, what if I have cancer?

Doctor
You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! 

Butters
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?

Katie
Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.

Doctor
Well alright, let me check for cysts.  Nooo!  That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! 

Katherine
Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.

Katie
I guess so Katherine.

Cartman
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!

Phillip
What the hell is this disgusting crap?!

Terrance
Queef Sisters?!

Network President
That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.

Terrance
You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!

Phillip
That's sick!

Network President
You think farts are funny; why not queefs?

Terrance
Because babies come from there!

Network President
Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!

Cartman
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!

Wendy
What's going on?

Stan
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!

Cartman
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!

Clyde
I threw up on my way home.

Cartman
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 

Stan
You tell 'em, Cartman!

Red
What happened?

Butters
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!

Kyle
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!

Bebe
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?

Cartman
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 

Bebe
I can't believe they're this upset.

Red
God, they're annoying!

Annie
I don't even know what a queef is.

Wendy
It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.

Annie
Oh.

Red
You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.

Bebe
Really?

Wendy
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

Cartman
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...

Kyle
Robbed us of our innocence.

Cartman
Yes, that's good.

Butters
Robbed us of our innocence... 

Wendy
Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.

Stan
What? 

Butters
Oh God, oh my God no! 

Stephen
Butters?

Randy
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 

Sharon
Why? What happened?

Randy
A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 

Sharon
...So?

Randy
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?

Stan
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.

Randy
I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.

Stan
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?

Randy
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. 

Gerald
How did this happen?

Stuart
Where were the teachers?!

Mrs. Testaburger
Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?

Man
Just?!

Thomas
We're here to find out why?!

Randy
The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 

Principal Victoria
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 

Randy
What does that have to do with anything? 

Regis
Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters! 

Katherine
Oh hello Regis.

Katie
Hello Kelly. 

Regis
So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.

Katherine
Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? 

Regis
But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?

Katie
Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?

Katherine
That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.

Kelly
Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 

Regis
D'ohhh! 

Network President
Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.

Terrance & Phillip
Fired?!

Network President
Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on.  Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies. 

Terrance
Brian, don't do this!

Phillip
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!

Brian
Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!

Martha
I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.

Randy
What was that?

Sharon
Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 

Randy
Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?

Sharon
Pardon me. 

Stan
Mom, gross! 

Randy
Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?

Sharon
Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.

Randy
Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!

Stan
Stop it, Mom!

Randy
Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?

Sharon
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

Randy
Sharon! Marsh!

Sharon
Ex-cuse me.

Shelly
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 

Randy
That's it, I'm leaving! 

Stan
I'm going too. 

Sharon
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!

Randy
That's completely different!

Stan
Yeah it's different, Mom!

Sharon
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.

Randy
Heh, yeah?

Sharon
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.

Randy
Yeah?

Sharon
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 

Randy
Come on Stanley, let's go. 

Sharon
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!

Randy
It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 

Katie
Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!

Katherine
But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie? 

Katie
Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!

Katherine
Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. 

Katie
Wooo.

Phillip
May we come in, please?

Katherine
Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. 

Terrance
Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.

Katie
Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could. 

Terrance
All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!

Phillip
That's right! We've come to kill you! 

Katie
Why kill us? We love you.

Terrance
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!

Katherine
Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.

Terrance
Your idols?

Katherine
We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. 

Terrance
I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 

Phillip
Why not? 

Terrance
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.

Phillip
What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 

Butters
Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 

Cartman
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?

Butters
Oh. Hey fellas.

Cartman
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.

Butters
Aw thanks.

Stan
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.

Butters
Ohhhhh ohhhhh!

Kyle
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.

Butters
My, my picture?

Cartman
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.

Terrance
AAH! 

Phillip
Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!

Terrance
No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.

Phillip
Oh. 

Katherine
Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. 

Terrance
Phillip?! I'm Terrance!

Katie
What? I thought you were Terrance.

Phillip
No, I'm Phillip!

Katherine
Oh dear. 

Stephen
A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.

Cartman
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.

Stan
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.

Randy
I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the Don't be scared  and of course there's the-

Woman
Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.

Other Women
That's right! We do.

Woman
For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 

Cartman
Sick! Stop it, lady!

Randy
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 

Woman 2
That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior. 

Road Warrior Queef
Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way.  Losers! Losers wait!

Males
AWWW!

Randy
Jesus Christ!

Phillip
You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 

Katherine
I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! 

Phillip
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!

Katherine
Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! 

Terrance
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.

Phillip
She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!

Terrance
SICK!

Katie
Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.

Terrance
What?! Gross! 

Katie
How dare you?! 

Katherine
Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again! 

Terrance
After everything we've been through? 

Terrance
What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.

Phillip
Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.

Terrance
Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

Phillip
Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.

Katie
Oh Terrance. 

Katherine
Phillip! 

Randy
Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!

Stan
No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!

Randy
Alright son! Yeah!!

Sharon
What's going on?

Randy
HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!

Sharon
Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.

Randy
Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...

Sharon
You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 

Stan
Mom, we didn't mean... 

Randy
Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 

Stan
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.

Randy
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.

Randy
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.

Randy, Stan
And realize we've been keeping women down.

Mr. Mackey
They have power and they have courage.

Stephen, Butters
And we must all stand by the belief,

Gerald, Kyle
That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.

The Males
Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you’re proud.

Randy
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.

The Males
You are woman now, and you are free to queef.

Cartman
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.

Mr. Garrison
They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.

The Males (Randy)
Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight!
Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free.

Bishop
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.  Nooo! 

Phillip
Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!

Bishop
Therefore what God has joined together let no man- 

Phillip
Aww. sick! 

Bishop
That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! 

Cartman
Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 

Jimmy
Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.

Cartman
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.

Jimmy
Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.

Cartman
Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.

Jimmy
Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.

Cartman
No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.

Jimmy
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-

Cartman
No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 

Jimmy
...So the Pope says, What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?

Cartman
Meh. 

Sarah
Here's some fruit, boys.  Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! 

Jimmy
Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.

Cartman
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?

Jimmy
You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 

Cartman
Yeah, I like fishsticks.

Jimmy
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? 

Cartman
What, dude, you got something?

Jimmy
Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?

Cartman
Yeah.

Jimmy
You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?

Cartman
Yeah.

Jimmy
Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?

Cartman
Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.

Butters
Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.

Jimmy
Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.

Cartman
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.

Clyde
Hey.

Stan
What's going on?

Butters
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.

Cartman
Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?

Clyde
Yes. 

Cartman
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?

Clyde
Yes. 

Cartman
What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?

Butters
HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 

Cartman
Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?

Token
Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. 

Cartman
Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?

Token
Yes.

Cartman
What are you?

Butters, Cartman
A gay fish? 

Butters
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 

Mr. Garrison
Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?

Mr. Mackey
Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?

Stephen
Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.

Peterson
Yeah, I like fishsticks.

Stephen
What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? 

Announcer
And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! 

Jimmy Kimmel
Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight?  So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?

The Guys
Yes.

Jimmy Kimmel
Huh. What are you, gay fish? 

David Letterman
And so uhhh, hay Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?

Paul Shaffer
Uhhh, sure?

David Letterman
What are you, Paul, a gay fish? 

Jay Leno
So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? 

Tom Snyder
It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.

Kanye
Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!

Tom Snyder
You. Really. Don't. Get it.

Kanye
Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!

Tom Snyder
You're a rapper.

Kanye
Yes.

Tom Snyder
An entrepreneur.

Kanye
Yes.

Tom Snyder
And you like fishsdicks.

Kanye
Yes.

Tom Snyder
You're a gay fish.

Kanye
No! I am not no gay fish!

Tom Snyder
Just gay?

Kanye
I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!

Tom Snyder
You are male?

Kanye
Damn right I'm male.

Tom Snyder
A male that like fish dicks.

Kanye
Yeah, I like fishsticks

Tom Snyder
You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.

Kanye
Yeah.

Tom Snyder
You're a gay fish.

Kanye
Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! 

Cartman
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.

Kyle
We know, Cartman!

Cartman
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.

Jimmy
P-patent?

Cartman
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.

Jimmy
Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.

Cartman
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 

Kyle
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?

Jimmy
Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...

Kyle
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.

Jimmy
Actually it was potato chips.

Kyle
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!

Jimmy
W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.

Craig
Then just give him half.

Kyle
What?

Craig
I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.

Kyle
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!

Craig
Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.

Kyle
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!

Craig
Just give him half.

Kanye
There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills.  Doctor, do I have gills?

Doctor
He does not have gills.

Kanye
You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?

Reporter 1
Do you like fishsticks?

Kanye
Love 'em!

Reporter 2
You're a gay fish. 

Kanye
No I'm not- AAAARGH! 

Conan O'Brien
Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.

Carlos Mencia
Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!

Conan O'Brien
So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?

Carlos Mencia
Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks? And my homeboy says Yeah Carlos you know, you're so funny! And then it just occurred to me. I said, Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!  And this is how I came up with it, my amigos! 

Cartman
Motherfucker!

Cartman
Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!

Jimmy
Really?

Cartman
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!

Jimmy
Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.

Cartman
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!

Jimmy
Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.

Cartman
What?!

Jimmy
Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.

Cartman
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?

Cartman
Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?

Jimmy
Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.

Cartman
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.

Sarah
Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.

Cartman
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 

Jimmy
Wow, thanks Eric.

Jimmy
Is that... Is that how it happened?

Cartman
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.

Jimmy
I'm... I'm sorry?

Cartman
It's cool man, it's cool. 

Announcer
Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!

Kanye
Yo. Ungh. Yo.  Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! 

Audience
Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!

Kanye
Yo, fuck this noise, yo! 

Kanye
Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?

House
Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.

Kanye
What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see...  Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish.

Aide 1
Kanye, really...

Kanye
Shut up!  Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks?  They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim.  Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?

House
No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words.

Kanye
I don't need anyone tellin' me play on words! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!

Cartman
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?

Kyle
Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.

Cartman
It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 

Kyle
You know what, Cartman? I believe you.

Cartman
You do?

Kyle
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 

Cartman
But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?

Cartman
Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?

Jimmy
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.

Cartman
That's cool. You wanna write some together? 

Jimmy
That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.

Cartman
Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks

Jimmy
Hey, you're really onto something there.

Sarah
Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.

Cartman
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... Do you like fishsticks?

Jimmy
Right. And then I say, Yeah.

Cartman
So then I can say, What are you, a gay fish?

Jimmy
Oh wow, this is incredible! 

Sarah
What is that?

Cartman
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 

Butters
Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.

Clyde
He's the most awesome kid in school!

Wendy
And he's not fat at all.

Cartman
Thanks you guys!

Cartman
Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.

Kanye
Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?

Aide 2
Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.

Kanye
Found who?

Aide 2
You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.

Carlos Mencia
Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan?  Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?

Kanye
You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.

Mencia
No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.

Kanye
Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!

Mencia
Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.

Kanye
I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.

Mencia
Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! 

Kanye
Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?

Mencia
'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.

Kanye
Why- Look at me, look at me!  I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. 

Mencia
You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. 

Ellen DeGeneres
Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it.  But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer.  Hey guys!

Cartman
Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.

Ellen
So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?

Jimmy
It was just a-

Cartman
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.

Ellen
But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?

Jimmy
Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-

Cartman
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 

Ellen
That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?

Jimmy
Yes Ma'am. 

Cartman
Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.

Ellen
I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? 

Cartman
Uhhh excuse me? 

Kanye
Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. 

Cartman
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.

Jimmy
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.

Cartman
Yeah, that was kewl huh?

Jimmy
Eric, there's something I really need to know.

Cartman
Whassat?

Jimmy
How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!

Cartman
So... here it is.

Jimmy
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!

Cartman
That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!

Kanye
Tie up these motherfuckers!  Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!

Jimmy
Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.

Kanye
Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!

Jimmy
Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-

Cartman
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!

Jimmy
Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-

Cartman
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!

Cartman
Hello Jim.

Jimmy
Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!

Cartman
What are you up to?

Jimmy
I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.

Cartman
Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 

Jimmy
Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 

Cartman
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.

Sarah
Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.

Cartman
Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, Do you like fishsticks in your mouth? 

Jimmy
What was that? 

Butters
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 

Cartman
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 

Wendy
You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.

Cartman
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish? There! 

Jimmy
Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!

Cartman
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.

Jimmy
What?!

Cartman
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.

Jimmy
Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?

Cartman
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.

Jimmy
What? I, I still don't get anything.

Cartman
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.

Jimmy
Rih, r-r-really?

Cartman
I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.

Jimmy
Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.

Kanye
He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me.  Boys I understand what you did now.  Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.

Aide 2
Yo Kanye! You sure about this?

Kanye
It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me.  Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys!  I'm goin' home! 

Kanye
(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish.

Randy
Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 

Sharon
Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.

Randy
We know!

Sharon
Well it's way past time for bed.

Randy
Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!

Sharon
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.

Randy
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 

Stan
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?

Randy
Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.

Stan
What is that?

Randy
It's, uh it's nothing, really.

Reporter
Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration.

Stan
Oh no, he didn't.

Reporter
The superconducting magnet was stolen sometime last week. Surveillance cameras were able to record the theft on tape and police are now looking for  Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. Caught here in these photos, the troubled rebel princess is seen taking the superconducting magnet and then appearing disoriented as she tries to find her way out.  If you have any information of Princess Leia's whereabouts, please call your local police department.

Judge
Alright Scouts and Dads, the racing continues. And it looks like our next heat is ready to go, in 3, 2, 1, race!  Two point one seconds for Tommy Bretts. Looks like we have a new leader, folks.

Tommy and His Dad
All right!

Randy
Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about tells.

Stan
Tells?

Randy
When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.

Stan
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-

Randy
Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 

Official
Looks good. Thank you and good luck today.  Alright, next please.  Name?

Stan
It's uh, Marsh. 

Official
Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hearby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?

Randy
Yes I do, yes I do.

Stan
Yes I do.

Official
Alright you man, good luck today. 

Randy
Oh! Yes! 

Mr. Hollis
Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.

Randy
Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?

Mr. Hollis
No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last.  Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built.

Randy
One point five?

Judge
The time to beat is 1.9 seconds. May we please have... Brewster, Marsh, Jarvis, and Hollis. 

Mr. Hollis
Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. 

Randy
Come on, Stan, you can do this! 

Judge
Alright, kids, are you ready? Here we go, last race for the state championship in 3, 2, 1, Go! 

Mr. Hollis
You got it Emmett! 

Randy
Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!

Announcer
This is Nine News at Ten.

Anchorman
A Colorado boy and his father have set a new record at the Pinewood Derby.  Stan and Randy Marsh not only broke a speed record, but actually appear to have bent time and space and discovered warp speed.  A parade was held for the winners earlier today , and already offers for commercials and endorsement deals for the father and son appear to be pouring in. 

Emmett
Dad, I just want you to know I still love you.  Waaaagh!  He's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK-

Agent Clark
Stan Marsh?

Stan
Yeah?

Agent Clark
I'm Agent Clark  and this is Agent Marx  We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.

Stan
Aw crap, Dad! 

Agent Clark
Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force.

Stan
Alien?

Agent Marx
Apparently the alien came across your Pinewood Derby car and is now headed to our planet.

Stan
What does it want?

Agent Clark
We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.

Randy
Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!

Stan
Dad they aren't here for that.

Randy
Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.

Agent Clark
Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.

Randy
What?  Hey, hey Sharon.

Agent Marx
NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here,

Randy
So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.

Sharon
What? Oh my God.

Randy
Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?

Reporter
The world holds its breath as an alien ship prepares to land. Now that our planet has achieved warp speed, we're about to be welcomed into the universal society. All thanks to a father and son who broke the warp barrier using only the parts in this  Pinewood Derby car kit.

General
Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. 

Randy
Hullo?

Britain
Godspeed, Mr.Marsh.

France
Ze nation of France iz with you.

Japan
Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh.

China
Prease say herro froma China.

Randy
Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 

Reporter
Our first encounter with extraterrestrial life is about to happen. Will it be like in Star Trek: First Contact? Or will it be more like Contact, with Jody Foster? 

Alien
I seek the life forms that made this. 

Randy
That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.

Alien
Oh yeah?  You're gonna build me another one, see?

Randy
He's got a gun!

Alien
Everyone down on the ground!  Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!

Townsman
You can't threaten us!  Ow!

McGee-zax
Who wants it next, huh?!  Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? 

Randy
What do you want?

McGee-zax
I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em! 

New Yorker
Screw this guy! He can't take out all of us!  Aargh!

McGee-zax
I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want!  You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?!

Judge
Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?

Randy
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.

Randy
Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.

McGee-zax
What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!

Stephen
Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.

Randy
We're working on it! 

Stan
Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.

Randy
Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.

Stan
Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.

Randy
Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!

McGee-zax
Alright, that does it! 

Randy
Hello?

Italy
They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!

Britain
Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!

Randy
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!

Stan
Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.

Randy
Awhuh. 

McGee-zax
Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.

Randy
What?! 

McGee-zax
You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?!  You tell 'em you ain't seen nothin', you got that?!  I ain't goin' to space jail! 

Officer 1
'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?

Randy
Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.

Officer 1
Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?

Randy
Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.

China
Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien.

France
Uh we've seen nothing here in France.

Randy
Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?

Officer 1
He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?

Randy
No, we're sure.

Officer 1
So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?

Randy
That's right, yep, you're the first ones.

Officer 1
You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.

Randy
...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!

Officer 1
If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-

Randy
We will give you a call!

Officer 1
Mathematical semi-tonal is fine. 

Officer 1
Huh.

Officer 2
Something wrong, sir?

Officer 1
I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. 

Randy
Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.

McGee-zax
I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! 

Randy
Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!

Scout Leader
That's true.

McGee-zax
I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!

Stan
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.

Randy
No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.

Stan
Kill the alien?

Randy
Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.

Stan
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.

McGee-zax
What are you two whispering about, riiight?

Randy
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.

Stan
Dad? 

Randy
Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!

General
Alright men, check the ship. 

Randy
You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.

Stan
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.

Randy
But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.

General
Hey Marsh, get in here! 

Stephen
Can you believe it?

Randy
Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 

General
Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.

Randy
Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?

Stephen
Huh?

Randy
Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.

Stan
No, Dad-

Mr. Garrison
He's right. We don't have to call the police back.

General
All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! 

Stan
Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?

Randy
Will you relax, Stan? 

Japan
Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!

Germany
That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!

Australia
Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!

Randy
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 

Randy
Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.

Officer 1
Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.

Randy
Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.

Officer 1
And so, did you find the missing space cash?

Randy
Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.

Officer 2
Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?

Randy
Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?

Russia
No space cash.

Japan
No we haven't-

Britain
No space cash.

Brazil
No.

Randy
Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.

Officer 1
Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.

Randy
Probably.

Officer 1
Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.

Randy
Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.

Officer 1
Uh huh. Have a good day. 

Randy
Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!

Randy
No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!

Japan
Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!

Randy
Nobody can build anything!!

Britain
Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!

Randy
Wha?! Finland?! 

Finland
We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.

Randy
Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.

Finland
I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.

Randy
Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?

Finland
Very well. 

Randy
All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.

China
Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.

Australia
Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? 

Randy
Oh dammit!

Randy
Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?

Officer 1
Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?

Randy
Whaa-wha-what about it

Officer 2
It appears to have been... destroyed.

Randy
Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.

Crowd
Oh no, not Finland.

Randy
Hey guys, Finland's dead.

Russia
Oh no. No! Nooo.

Japan
Noo, not a Finrand!

Kenya
All of Finland, gone.

Randy
Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.

Officer 1
None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?

Randy
No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.

Officer 2
We didn't say anything about nukes.

Randy
Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.

Stan
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 

Judge
What?

Randy
Stan?

Stan
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 

Japan
Not in the approved kit?!

Britain
He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?

Stan
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 

Randy
Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.

Officer 1
Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?

Randy
Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?

Britain
Nope.

France
Nope.

South Korea
No changes.

Kenya
Nope.

Russia
No changes.

Brazil
Nope.

China
No. Tell them no.

Australia
No changes.

Randy
Yeah, no, we've told you everything.

Officer 1
All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. 

Randy
Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!

McGee-zax
My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing. 

Britain
What the hell are they talking about?

Kevern Zaksor
These are not space cops.  There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?

Randy
It was... a trick?

Officer 2
Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.

Kevern Zaksor
Needless to say, you all failed.  People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. 

Randy
No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!

Cartman
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!

Butters
We can?

Stan
What are you talking about, dude?

Cartman
Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.

Clyde
Somalia? Where's that?

Cartman
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.

Butters
Whoa.

Cartman
I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.

Kyle
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.

Cartman
Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.

Kyle
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.

Cartman
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.

Kyle
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.

Cartman
Then why don't you wanna go?

Kyle
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...

Kyle, Cartman
Jews can't be pirates.

Cartman
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 

Kyle
Please. Please let him go.

Gordon Stoltski
Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday.  Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:

Cartman

Butters
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 

Cartman
Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?

Clyde
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.

Cartman
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.

Gordon Stoltski
Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! 

Cartman
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!

Butters
Yeah!

Cartman
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!

Clyde
And your mom is okay with that?

Cartman
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?

Butters

Cartman
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 

Butters
Pirates ho!

Cartman

Clerk
I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?

Cartman
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.

Butters
Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.

Cartman
What?!

Butters
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.

Clyde
Yeah maybe we should think about this.

Cartman
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?

Butters
Huh, who, you mean you?

Cartman
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!

Butters
No, I'm sick of it!

Cartman
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?

Butters
He's right, lads. To adventure!

Clyde
This is Somalia?

Butters
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?

Cartman
The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.

Butters
Uhh,  mahjey burazi?

Somali 1
Burad. Iyaja dene zaredeko

Somali 2
Buradi wakuwasa.

Butters
Oh. He-he says they're in there. 

Cartman
Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 

Somali 2
Mayasuk! Hageha-aden! Letka suwahater! 

Cartman
Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. 

Cartman
Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.

Pirate 1
Is this some kind of joke?

Pirate 2
I don't know what the fuck this is!

Cartman
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with

Pirate 1
These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!

Pirate 2
Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages! 

Cartman
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.

Pirate 3
Move it! Go over that way!

Pirate 4
We will get a nice ransom for you! 

Cartman
Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 

Pirate 3
Get on board!

Pirate 4
Do it now! 

Cartman
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!

Pirate 3
Get on the boat now!

Pirate 4
Move!

Cartman
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.

Kevin
I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. 

Cartman
Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!

Clyde
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 

Cartman
Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!

Clyde
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!

Cartman
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 

French Captain
Keep your eyes open, Mr. Leon. These waters are full of renegades and thieves.

Mr. Leon
Yes, Captain! 

Deck Hand
Captain! We have an unknown vessel approaching quickly to port!

French Captain
Damn pirates! Alert the crew! All hands on deck! 

Pirate 5
We demand ransom for these children! Pay us or we will kill them!

French Captain
They've got CHILDREN HOSTAGES!

Cruise Attendant
My God!

French Captain
Get the U.N. on the radio. Advise them of the situation.

Pirate 5
We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!

Cartman
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!

Pirate 4
We are going to start killing them! Starting with the fat one!

Cartman
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!

Butters
ARRRRRRGH!

Kyle
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?

Stan
No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.

Kyle
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!

Stan
You really think he'll die in Somalia?

Kyle
Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.

Sheila
Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 

Gerald
Take it easy. We'll find him.

Kyle
I'll call you back. 

Sheila
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!

Kyle
What? Are you sure?

Sheila
He left a note saying he's never coming back.

Kyle
Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a- to be a pirate?! Oh shit!

Sheila
Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?

Gerald
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 

Kyle
Oh God. What have I done?

Pirate 4
We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!

Cartman
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!

French Captain
Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!

Pirate 5
The money first!  Go! Get on the boat! Move!

Cartman
Alright, let's go! 

Cruise Attendant
We got 'em - They're safe! 

French Captain
Your crimes will not go unpunished!  Are you kids alright?

Cruise Attendant
Did they hurt you?

Cartman
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!

French Captain
What is this?!

Cartman
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!

Butters
Okay! 

Cartman
I said, get off my boat!

French Captain
Hey! You can't order us around! 

Cartman
That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike. 

French Captain
Scoundrels! You will pay for this!

Butters
Have a good day! 

Cartman
Hard to port, lads!

Clyde
Hard to port!

Butters
What's port?!

Cartman
Just make the boat go that way, kind of.  That's good. Now bring her around portside.  Now that's a pirate ship!  A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves?  Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around.  A round of grog for me boys!  A round of grog for everyone!  The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys!

Paolo Captain
We found then adrift in a lifeboat, sir. They say that pirates took their ship by force.

U.N. Leader
Damn pirates! What's causing them to suddenly be so much more active? Is the crew okay?

Paolo Captain
Yes sir. They're French, so they surrendered immediately.  Once the pirates boarded your ship how did they force you off?

French Captain
Il a vert lightsabeur.

Cruise Attendant
Oui. Un lightsabeur

Deck Hand
Le lightsabeur terrible. 

Paolo Captain
Sir, the pirates appear to have forced the French crew off their boat with a lightsaber.

U.N. Leader
My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live.

Cartman
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?

Pirate 6
We have a hostage!

Pirate 7
Another American arrived on the bus!

Cartman
Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!

Announcer
The is CNN... N.

Anchorman
Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.

Cartman
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.

Kyle
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.

Cartman
It isn't safe. That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was awesome.

Kyle
I know! I was lying then!

Cartman
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.

Kyle
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!

Cartman
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.

Butters
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.

Pirate 4
Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?

Butters
Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.

Galeed
Why did you Americans come here?

Butters
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.

Ike
Yeah, homework.

Butters
And our parents hollered at us!

Ike
Yeah.

Butters
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.

Ike
Piewets!

Galeed
But that's not what I do not understand. Why would anyone want to be a pirate?

Butters
Huh?

Galeed
Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would. 

Ike
Oh my God. 

Butters
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?

Ike
I feel, like an asshole.

Butters
Yeah, me too.

Cartman
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!

Kyle
Cartman, knock it off!

Cartman
That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!

Pirate 6
Do you think all American kids are as crazy as these are?

Pirate 8
It's starting to look that way.

Butters
Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.

Cartman
What?!

Butters
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 

Cartman
Clyde!

Clyde
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 

Cartman
You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!

Kyle
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!

Cartman
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!

Pirate 5
Hey, what's that? 

Commander
Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!

Cartman
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 

Sniper
Clear.

Cartman
The FUCK?!

Gerald
You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 

Sheila
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 

Gerald
What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!

Ike
I'm scared. There's a ghost.

Gerald
Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!

Ike
But Daddy I saw the-

Gerald
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 

Sheila
Gerald, what has gotten into him?

Gerald
Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser.

Ike
AAAAAAAAA!

Billy Mays
Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!

Ike
Billy Mays, NO! 

Billy Mays
Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away.

Ike
MMOOMMMYYY!  AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett!  AAAAAA! David Carradine! 

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. 

Ike
NOOOOO!

Kyle
Ike! Ike, what?!

Ike
Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away!  Make him stop!  Make him stop, Kyle!

Dr. Land
Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay.

Ike
No, it's... it's a secret.

Dr. Land
Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else.

Ike
I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.

Dr. Land
You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?

Ike
I see them walking around. They talk to me.

Dr. Land
Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?

Ike
Just Ed McMahon. 

Dr. Land
How often do you see dead celebrities?

Ike
All the time. 

Cartman
'Sup, Jew?

Kyle
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.

Cartman
HA! What a dumbass! 

Kyle
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name Billy Mays over and over again.

Cartman
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!

Kyle
What?

Cartman
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?

Stan
Dude, I don't even know who that is.

Cartman
The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle , but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear .

Man 1
I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. 

Billy Mays
Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away.  Just one Chipotle burrito  can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood , but Chipotl-away  makes your underwear clean  and ready for more.  Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new.  Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.

Man 2
Mmm, Chipotle. 

Billy Mays
Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want , and still have underwear that sparkles and shines . Order right now!

Cartman
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.

Kyle
What?! Are you serious?!

Cartman
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.

Kyle
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!

Cartman
Because he was a great person, Kyle.

Kyle
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!

Cartman
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...

Announcer
On this episode of Ghost Hunters : a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities.  Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!

Jason
Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.

Kris
We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-

Jason
Wait, what? What was that? What was that?

Grant
I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*

Jason
Is there a ghost here?

Jason
Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?

Kris
Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.

Jason
Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?

Grant
I think that's just a cigarette lighter.

Jason
Oh, right, okay. May be.

Jason
We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?

Kyle
What was what?

Jason
Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? 

Grant
I'm pretty sure that's their television.

Jason
Oh man I am really scared.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! 

Grant
I see it!

Jason
W... what is it?!

Grant
Oh God I'm so scared!  I'm so scared.

Jason
Look! Look, it's got you too!  Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!

Grant
It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. 

Jason
Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??

Stan
Are you guys fucking serious?

Jason
Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! 

Grant
Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. 

Jason
Oh it smells!

TAPS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Kyle
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.

Kyle
It's all just in your head, Ike.

Billy Mays
The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders

Ike
AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! 

Kyle
I just... don't understand it.

Stan
It's gonna be alright, Kyle.

Kyle
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?

Cartman
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.

Kyle
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?

Stan
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.

Cartman
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.

Dr. Carroll
Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.

Stan
Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?

Dr. Carroll
Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. 

Dr. Phillips
The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it.  I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.

Kyle
Purgatory? What's that?

Dr. Phillips
Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called purgatory. It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.

Cartman
Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...

Dr. Phillips
I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. 

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.

Cartman
Billy Mays!  It's him!

Billy Mays
Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?

Cartman
Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!

Walter Cronkite
No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!

Dr. Phillips
To which celebrity am I addressin' now?

Walter Cronkite
This, is Walter Cronkite.

Dr. Phillips
All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.

Farrah Fawcett
We know that!

DJ AM
Yeah! Of course we know that!

Patrick Swayze
There's only one person here who's not cooperating!

Walter Cronkite
That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!

Michael Jackson
...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.

Stan
Uh oh.

Walter Cronkite
You are dead!

Michael Jackson
No, I just have a skin condition.

Dr. Phillips
Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.

Kyle
What?

Dr. Phillips
He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.

Kyle
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.

Michael Jackson
Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.

Kyle
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.

The Boys (except Cartman) and Dr. Phillips
Shut up, Billy Mays!

Stan
You're dead, Mr. Jackson!

Michael Jackson
No, that's, that's just ignorant.

Stan
Accept it! 

Michael Jackson
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

Dr. Phillips
He's in too much denial!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 

Kyle
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.

Ike
Nooo. No, that's ignorant.  Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.

Kyle
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!

Ike
Wee, I'm a child!  I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree! 

Kenny
(Holy shit, dude!)

Kyle
Comoe back here! 

Kyle
Hey! Heeey!

Ike
Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!

Stan
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!

Ike
Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play!  Hee! Hee hee!  Hee hee hee! 

Kyle
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!

Cartman
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!

Ike
No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! 

Kyle
What the hell are we going to do??

Ike
Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!

Ed McMahon
Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!

Passengers
Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!

Flight Attendant
Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours

Passengers
AWWWWWWWW!

DJ AM
Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!

Flight Attendant
We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.

Walter Cronkite
That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!

Flight Attendant
Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!

Walter Cronkite
You've been saying that for three months now! 

Stan
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...

Kyle
Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?

Cartman
Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.

Kyle
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?

Cartman
Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 

Kyle
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?

Cartman
Yes!

Kyle
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?

Cartman
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 

Stan
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.

Kyle
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?

Cartman
A child... and a female. And white.

Ike
Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.

Stan
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.

Kyle
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 

MC
Hello. First up we have the beautiful Miss Jessica. 

Jessica's Mom
Alright Jessica! Woohoo! 

MC
Jessica enjoys ridin' her horse Marley and doin' her nails with her sisters. Next, contestant number 26, Miss Brandy 

Brandy's Mom
Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!

MC
Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.

Brandy's Mom
Don't forget to blow a kiss to the judges, Brandy. 

MC
And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson. 

Kyle
Go on by, Michael. 

Cartman
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!

Stan
Yeahhhh!

MC
Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.

Ike
Ignorant.

Cartman
God I hope this works.

Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-

Walter Cronkite
Will somebody shut his fucking mouth?! I can't take it anymore!

Patrick Swayze
This is bad enough without having to constantly listen to you try and sell your stupid crap, Mays!

Billy Mays
With just two easy steps, I can climb over these seats and kick you right in the fucking balls!

David Carradine
That does it. We are not gonna just sit here anymore! We want some Goddamned answers!

Walter Cronkite
Why isn't anybody telling us anything?!

Pilot
Well ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking.

Walter Cronkite
Well it's about fucking time!

Pilot
Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.

DJ AM
But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!

Flight Attendant
Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.

Passengers
AWWWWWWWW!

Ike
Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.

Stan
Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.

Kylie's Mom
It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.

Kylie
Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants. 

MC
All right, thank you Miss Cassie. And now for her talent portion, Miss Michael Jackson is gonna sing for us. 

Ike
I'm just a little girl. Hee hee. A dainty little thing.And I know you all want to be a little white girl like me. Shamohn! Hee hee hee.  Hohhh

Stan
Dude, the two male judges love her.

Kenny
(Yeah.) 

An Officer
All right, that's about enough! 

Kyle
Aww crap!

Cartman
Hey, what the F?!

MC
All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.

Kyle
We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!

Stan
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.

Heidi's Mom
You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.

Kyle
Aw dide, this is hopeless!

Kenny
(Son of a stinking bitch!)

Cartman
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.

Kyle
So what?!

Cartman
So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.

Lady Judge
Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-... 

Cartman
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?

Lady Judge
How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter.  I'm just gonna have to give it up.

Cartman
What if you didn't have to give it up?

Lady Judge
Excuse me?

Cartman
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.

MC
And now, it is time to announce our Grand Little Miss. Little Miss Michael Jackson. 

Kyle
Yeah!

Cartman
Yeah!

Stan
Woohoo!

Cartman
Good job Ike! 

Heidi
I'm sorry I didn't win, Mommy. 

Ike
Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free!  Holy shit! What the heck am I wwwearing?

Kyle
Ike!  Ike, you're back!

Ike
Kyle, what the heck is going on?

Kyle
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.

Cartman
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.

Michael Jackson
Wee, I'm free! I'm free! 

Farrah Fawcett
Hey he's here! He's here!

Bea Arthur
Oh, finally.

Others
He's here! He's back!

Flight Attendant
All right everyone, it looks like we are all ready to move on. 

Michael Jackson
Did you all see my crown? 

Billy Mays
Finally! Finally we can all move on!

Flight Attendant
All right, everyone, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the gates of Hell. Unfortunately, Hell is a tow-in gate.

Passengers
AWWWWWWWW!

Cartman
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. Come on, dude, I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. 

Butters
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.

Cartman
Alright, your turn Craig.

Butters
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 

Cartman
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.

Butters
Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.

Stan
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!

Cartman
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 

Butters
Uugh!

Kyle
So what?

Butters
So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!

Craig
That's right. 

Clyde
You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.

Butters
Sellin' kisses?

Clyde
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.

Butters
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?

Clyde
So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.

Butters
Oh boy, I sure am nervous.

Cartman
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.

Kyle
Butters, I think you should reconsider this.

Butters
Uh, how come?

Kyle
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.

Cartman
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?

Butters
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!

Butters
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?

Francis
Pretty worth it. 

Jimmy
Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.

Butters
I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.

Sally
Hey. 

Butters
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.

Sally
Okay, cool.

Butters
Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 

Sally
So you got money?

Butters
Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 

Sally
All right, you ready? 

Butters
Thank you! 

Cartman
Atta boy Butters!

Tweek
You did it!

Jimmy
You're a man now! All right Butters good job!

Token
Good job, Butters!

Butters
Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.

Butters
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!

Scott
She'll kiss anybody?

Butters
Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!

Scott
Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 

Sally
Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.

Butters
Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.

Sally
Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.

Butters
Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?

Sally
What?

Butters
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.

Sally
Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.

Butters
We could have our very own...  kissin' company.

Butters
The next key to a successful business is innovation. I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?

Sally
Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.

Butters
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.

Megan
Got it.

Butters
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.

Sally
This is gonna be great!

Murphy
Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible prostitution company starting up in South Park.

Yates
What?!  Hohoo, not in my county!

Murphy
We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.

Yates
So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!

Murphy
Sting operation, sir?

Yates
We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!

Yates
Hey baby, you looking for a party?

Driver
Ha... how much are you charging?

Yates
Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.

Driver
Aww- get in. 

Yates
Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.

Driver
Ok-okay. 

Yates
All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants.  All right! Here we go. 

Driver
Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.

Yates
Oh that's all right.  Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE!  You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!

Driver
Awhuh! What?!

Yates
This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.

Kyle
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.

Stan
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.

Kenny
(Stacey Anderson?) 

Butters
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.

Stan
Butters, you're the one doing all this?

Butters
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 

Cartman
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?

Butters
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.

Kyle
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 

Butters
...A pimp. Huh...

Butters
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.' Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 

Sally
Oh. 

Butters
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.

Butters
Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.

Bishop
You? You be pimpin?

Butters
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.

Bishop
Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.

Butters
What's the game?

Bishop
The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your bottom bitch. That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?

Butters
Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.

Pimp 2
See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?

Butters
I know what you're saying.

Pimp 2
Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?

Butters
Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!

Stephen
There you are, Butters!

Butters
Hey Dad!

Stephen
Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?

Butters
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 

Driver 2
I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?

Yates
No way! Let's just get to this, baby.

Driver 2
Alright.

Yates
So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?

Driver 2
Sure, I have the money right here.

Murphy
Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, stretch.

Officer
Code word is stretch, copy?

Yates
Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.

Driver 2
Oh, you feel good.

Yates
Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.

Driver 2
Oh yes. That's great. 

Yates
Yeah, you like it?

Driver 2
Oh, I love it!

Yates
Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!

Yates
Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!

Driver 2
Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!

Yates
Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!

Yates
Teach this little whore a lesson!

Driver 2
Yeah! Yeah!

Yates
Yeah, that's right!

Driver 2
Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh!  Awh.  Oh, oh man!  Thank you! That was great.

Yates
Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a...  STRETCH.

Murphy
Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! 

Driver 2
Oh God! It's the police!

Yates
Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! 

Driver 2
Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!

Yates
A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.

Groundskeeper
That's it recess is over back to class.

Kids
Aaaaaaah.

Butters
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.

Ashley
So wait, you're keeping all the money now?

Butters
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?

Mr. Garrison
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.

Butters
Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.

Bebe
What?

Butters
Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?

Bebe
What?!

Butters
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.

Bebe
Shut up!

Butters
Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?

Wendy
Leave me alone.

Butters
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.

Stan
Butters. Dude!

Butters
What?

Stan
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!

Butters
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!

Wendy
Stan!

Stan
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!

Butters
Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.

Clyde
Wow wee. 

Cartman
Dude, we've created a monster.

Butters
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.

Mr. Garrison
Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!

Butters
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!

Butters
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 

Kyle
Butters, I really think we should talk.

Butters
Sure, Kyle.

Kyle
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.

Butters
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.

Kyle
Butters, what's happened to you?

Butters
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 

Frat Boy 1
Alpha Tau Omega, woo!

Frat Boy 2
ATOs!

Frat Boy 3
Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today!  And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. 

Frat Boys
Eewwww!

Singer
Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?

Yates
Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. 

Murphy
Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?

Yates
What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.

Bishop
Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now.

Yates
Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.

Bishop
I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?

Yates
Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 

Black Bitch
Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?

White Bitch
He's an asshole.

Black Bitch
You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.

White Bitch
A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. 

Butters
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 

Charise
Did I do good, Daddy?

Butters
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.

Charise
Thank you, Daddy. 

Butters
Mmmwhoa boy!

Butters
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.

Receptionist
And exactly what kind of business are you running?

Butters
It's a kissing company.

Receptionist
And you're making a profit?

Butters
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.

Receptionist
Do you keep any record of the men getting these kisses?

Butters
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.

Receptionist
Senator Morris?

Butters
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?

Receptionist
Where?

Butters
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.

Receptionist
Alright, get out of here! 

Butters
Huh? Why?

Receptionist
I'm not falling for it!

Butters
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!

Receptionist
We aren't giving you anything; get out! 

Boss
Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?

Receptionist
Eh no sir.

Butters
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 

Butters
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.

Sally
Okay.

Charise
Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?

Sally
What?

Charise
I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.

Sally
Hey, screw off, ho.

Charise
Fair is fair, ho.

Butters
Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!

Yates
Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?

Butters
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.

Yates
Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.

Bishop
Yolanda!  Yolanda!

Butters
What's that?

Bishop
Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!

Yates
You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!

Bishop
Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want...  I want to marry you. 

Yates
It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.

Butters
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.

Bishop
Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did.  Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this.

Yates
Oh Keshawn! 

Butters
Wha? Awww.

Bishop
I love you so much.

Yates
Babe, I love you too.

Bishop
So much, baby.

Yates
Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?

Bishop
Promise, babe. Promise.

Butters
Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 

Butters
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!

Bishop
Happy anniversary baby.  Do you like 'em?

Yates
I love 'em, darling.

Bishop
I wanted to get you something extra-special.

Yates
Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the...  FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!

John Cena
Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!

Edge
Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!

Spectators
Oooooooooooooooooooooo!

Darryl Weathers
Bust him up, Edge!

Obese Woman
Kick his ass! WOO!

John Cena
Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. 

Redneck 1
Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?

Cartman
Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!

Stan
I'm having the best time!

Edge
You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! 

Darryl Weathers
He took his job!

Redneck 2
He took his jrrr?

Redneck 3
Took hid drrr! 

Cartman
Oh, sweet! 

Edge
Whoa... 

Butters
Yes! Yehhehehes!

Cartman
This is awesome!

Cartman
Dude! That was so badass!

Kyle
Wrestling is awesome!

Stan
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 

Cartman
The fuck is this?!

Stan
Why did they have us put on long underwear.

Kyle
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.

Butters
Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.

Kyle
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?

Cartman
I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!

Coach
Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.

Kyle
Cool!

Stan
Yeah!

Butters
Let's do this!

Cartman
All right!

Coach
Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?

Cartman
The Rad Russian.

Coach
What?

Cartman
You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!

Coach
Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.

Cartman
Huh?

Coach
Just, down on, down on the floor.  Hands and knees. 

Cartman
Okay...

Coach
Alright and now how about you. Your name is?

Butters
Triceratops!

Coach
Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position.  Here- we- go.

Cartman
The fuck is this?!

Coach
Now just reach around him here. Good.

Cartman
Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!

Coach
Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!

Cartman
That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!

Stan
Yeah, what are you? A child molester?

Kyle
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!

Coach
Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!

The Boys
Yeah! 

Coach
Ugh.  The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! 

Cartman
Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 

Stan
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.

Butters
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 

Coach
Rrrgh!

Cartman
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say You slept with my girlfriend, and I'll charge you into a head slap.

Jimmy
Sounds good.

Cartman
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like No no, the fight hasn't started yet, and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.

Butters
Okey doke.

Jimmy
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?

Cartman
Noo, let's save the girlfriend is a whore line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.

Butters
Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!

Cartman
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?

Stan
Yup.

Cartman
Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 

Jimmy
I am gonna k-kick your ass!

Cartman
You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 

Butters
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.

Cartman
Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!

Jimmy
Your girlfriend is a whore!

Cartman
Wait for it, wait for the whore line.

Jimmy
Oh, I'm sorry.

Token
You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!

Stan
We'll see about that!

Butters
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!

Redneck 4
What's goin' on?

Redneck 5
Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.

Redneck 4
Jeez they're so young.

Kyle
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!

Butters
That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!

Stan
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!

Cartman
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!

Stan
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.

Redneck 6
That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!

Redneck 7
Good for you for serving your country!

Redneck 8
Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!

Redneck 9
Are you serious?

Kyle
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!

Token
I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!

Redneck 10
That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?

Redneck 11
Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife.

Redneck 12
They're married?

Jimmy
You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back

Cartman
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!

Redneck 9
That Russian kid's got hepatitis?

Announcer
And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! 

Jimmy
What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?

Kenny
(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)

Kyle
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!

Stan
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!

Kyle
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?

Announcer
Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! 

Cartman
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.

Stan
What?!

Redneck 13
No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!

Redneck 14
Don't break his heart!

Stan
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!

Cartman
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 

Kyle
Irene, no! Why?

Cartman
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.

Redneck 15
Whoa, did you hear that?

Redneck 16
Shh!

Stan
Irene, you said you loved me!

Cartman
I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 

Spectators
Ohhhh!  Ahhhh!

Darryl Weathers
I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine.

Redneck 13
There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good.

Darryl Weathers
Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there.

Redneck 17
You're shittin' me!

Redneck 13
No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! 

Darryl Weathers
You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.

Coach
It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! 

Redneck 13
What do you mean, it ain't real?

Coach
It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!

Darryl Weathers
Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just  not real to you!  Son of a bitch.

Coach
Look look look!  THIS is wrestling. THIS. 

Darryl Weathers
Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar.

Stan
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.

Kyle
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.

Cartman
Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?

Butters
Yeah!

Kyle
Let's do this! One! Two!

Boys
Backyard wrestling!

Cartman
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.

Stan
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!

Redneck 13
Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.

Redneck 18
Shhh.

Principal Victoria
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.

Coach
You're firing me? Why?!

Principal Victoria
The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 

Coach
No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!

Principal Victoria
I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.

Coach
You can't fire me for what these kids do!

Principal Victoria
That isn't the only reason you're being let go.

Coach
What do you mean?

Principal Victoria
We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.

Kyle
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.

Token
Oh! Sure, that works.

Cartman
You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!

Kyle
What dude? 

Cartman
We just received a letter from the WWE.

Stan
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?

Butters
No way!

Cartman
Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.

Stan
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?

Kyle
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 

Stan
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..

Kyle
Oh my God... Oh my God...

Token
I can't believe it's him.

Butters
I'm freaking out...

Kyle
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!

Cartman
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.

Stan
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!

Darryl Weathers
Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.

Redneck 19
Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. 

Darryl Weathers
Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.

Kyle
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 

Stan
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 

Butters
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?

Kyle
I'll fight anytime, anywhere!

Redneck 20
He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. 

Crowd
Oohhhhh!  Boooooooo!

Stan
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 

Announcer
It's El Pollo Loco! 

Cartman
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.

Kyle
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.

Cartman
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.

Kenny
(Yeah, we've been talking.)

Cartman
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.

Stan
Yeah?

Cartman
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.

Kenny
(Yep.)

Kyle
What are you talking about?

Cartman
Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!

Stan
He's right.

Kyle
What?

Stan
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.

Cartman
Right?

Stan
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.

Kyle
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.

Cartman
No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.

Kenny
(They're gonna hurt our chances.)

Cartman
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!

Kyle
So what do we do?

Kenny
(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)

Cartman
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.

Stan
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.

Kyle
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?

Cartman
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.

Cartman
Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!

Number 17
You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-

Cartman
Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!

Number 24
Your father! Your own father!  I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!

Cartman
Thank you. 

Kyle
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.

Kenny
(Mhm.)

Stan
Yeah yeah, not bad.

Cartman
Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?

Number 37
Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died.  Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. 
All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?

Stan
Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.

Cartman
Yeah, this guy crushes.

Coach Connors
It isn't fair. All my hard work.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  That wrestling show is in for a big surprise.  I'm putting an end to this once and for all!  Hyaaaaa!

Kyle
He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 

Jimmy
Oowow, it's really him.

Stan
He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-

Cartman
Alright, places everyone.

Cartman
Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 

Stan
Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?

Kyle
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.

Stan
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?

Kyle
Wait a minute. Who is that?

Stan
It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 

Kyle
You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!

Cartman
My man can do whatever he wants.

Coach Connors
Stay calm, you know what you have to do.

Cartman
You're just gonna have to deal with that.

Coach Connors
For the good of real wrassling. 

Butters
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!

Cartman
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.

Stan
No, you can't possibly mean that-!

Cartman
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!

Crowd
Awwwww!

Butters
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!

Number 37
Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?

Redneck 21
He's alive!

Cartman
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!

Assistant
What do you thnk?

Stan
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.

Vince
They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. 

Jimmy
Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!

Butters
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!

Guard
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits

Butters
Are you sure?

Coach Connors
Oh don't mind me.  I was just about to- 

Guard
Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?

Cartman
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!

Stan
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!

Butters
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!

Jimmy
Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!

Kenny
(I can keep the baby...)

Cartman
Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!

Coach Connors
Only one shot.  Maximum damage.  This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING!  NO! 

Fan 1
O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!

Fan 2
Bastardos! 

Coach Connors
No! No, shut up!  You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! 

Redneck 22
We want some real wrestlers!

Coach Connors
This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling!  Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!

Darryl Weathers
What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!

Coach Connors
Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!

Crowd
Huh? What?

Redneck 5
They took his job.

Redneck 23
I know. Sshh. 

Coach Connors
You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother.

Darryl Weathers
Oh man, they took his job?

Redneck 13
They took hid-drr.

Coach Connors
Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!

Redneck 24
They took his dog!

Redneck 25
They tok hid-drr!

Redneck 5
Took hid-drrr!

Coach Connors
I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spent the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!

Redneck 26
They broke his jaw!

Redneck 22
Theeyy broke his jaw!

Redneck 27
Brk hij-jrr! 

Coach Connors
So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. 

Vince
Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen.

Coach Connors
What?

Vince
Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.

Coach Connors
You, you mean it?

Vince
Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! 

Kyle
What?

Stan
Dude.

Cartman
Hey, what about us? Our show? 

Vince
Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has.

The Boys
Aaaaah.

Cartman
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!

Kyle
Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!

Jimmy
Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!

Stan
What?? 

Jimmy
You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!

Stan
Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 

Redneck 28
What the hell's this?

Redneck 29
This is Goddamned fake!

Darryl Weathers
Screw this, this is just stupid. 

Cartman
Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!

Redneck 30
FAKE!

Cartman
Kenny! I'm-

Trainer 1
All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium.  My name is Chet and I'll be your guide and trainer as you meet these intelligent and truly magical creatures.  And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles

Stan
Wow cool.

Randy
Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?

Stan
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.

Chet
If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?

Girl
I would like to-

Randy
MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!

Trainer 1
Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water.  The- 

Stan
What the hell is that? 

Trainer 2
Oh no it's the Japanese! 

Japanese Man 1
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!

Japanese Man 2
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you dofiiin! 

Guide
These are our favorite animals here at the Atlanta Zoo. It's Dolly and Seymour. They are beluga whales. These whales live mostly in the Arctic region- 

Japanese Man 3
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!

Trainer 3
All right Jessica, now put your arms down like this.  Great job, Jessica!

Japanese Man 4
Fuck you, whaaale! 

Trainer 3
AAAAAAAA!

Randy
Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.

Stan
Dad, why did they do that?

Randy
Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 

Commentator 1
Dan Dierdorf here, welcoming you to this great football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. We're all set for kickoff and- 

Commentator 2
Oh Dan it looks like Japanese people are now rushing onto the field.  This is not the kind of thing you want happening during kickoff. 

Japanese Man 5
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!

News Anchor
Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco.  Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say

Hatoyama
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru , anda fuck you dohfiiin! 

Cartman
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.

Stan
Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.

Cartman
What do you mean? This song is sweet.

Stan
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.

Kyle
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.

Stan
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?

Kyle
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.

Stan
It seems like everyone has an attitude of that's just the way they are or that's just the way it is! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!

Cartman
I'm not too busy, Stan.

Stan
You're not?

Cartman
No, I just don't care. At all.

Kenny
(Yeah, me neither.)

Stan
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?

Cartman
Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!

Stan
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 

Cartman
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.

Butters
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.

Stan
Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?

Butters
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.

Stan
Really?  People who are doing something?

Butters
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.

Stan
Then that's where I belong.

Singer
The world is a vampire, sent to drain.

Captain Paul Watson
Yeah, we're badass.

Singer
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.

Male Crew 1
Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates! 

Captain
That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Looks like they're whaling now. 

Japanese Sailor
Fuck youuu, weiruu!

First Mate
Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!

Woman
We've gotta do something!

Captain
Pull up next to them. The fight is on!

Stan
Sweet! 

Captain
Are we ready to do this?

Crew
Yeah!

Stan
Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!

Captain
Are we badasses?

Crew, Stan
Yeah!

Captain
Are we badasses?

Crew, Stan
Yeah!

Captain
All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?

Crewman
Great idea, Captain!

Aussie Crewman
I'll start right now. 

Woman
Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales.

Captain
Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?

Stan
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.

Captain
Why not?

Stan
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!

Captain
You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! 

Luke
Haha, you stink now! Haha!

Stan
Wait, that's it?

Captain
Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.

Stan
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.

Captain
Well no, that'd be illegal.

Crewman 2
Yeah.

Stan
I thought you guys were pirates in a war!

Woman
I'm a pirate in a war.

Stan
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!

Captain
We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!

Luke
The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are. 

Woman
Paul! 

Crewman
Paul?

Crewman 2
What do we do?

Woman
We don't have a captain!

Crewman
Oh my God, oh my God!

Woman 2
Maybe he's okay.

Crewman 2
Oh my God.

Luke
What did you do?

Stan
What you assholes acted like you were doing? 

Stan
Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! 

The Japanese
Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira! 

Hatoyama
Nippon no gaijin!  Kuso, taberu na! 

Announcer
And now, Larry King, live.

Larry King
My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.

Luke
'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!

Larry King
So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?

Stan
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.

Larry King
Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?

Stan
...No, I don't care about the show.

Woman 2
We're pirates.

Stan
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls

Woman 2
I've got balls! 

Larry King
Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and...  You say Stan's methods are unethical.

Sid
Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.

Larry King
But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.

Sid
Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.

Stan
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!

Larry King
But their old captain, Paul Watson , was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause.

Sid
He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-

Stan
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!

Announcer
On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere. 

Stan
Would you mind stepping back a little?

Luke
Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade! 

Stan
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.

Luke
But they say you know them. 

Cartman
Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .

Stan
Oh no, no, NO.

Cartman
What dude?

Stan
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?

Cartman
We always have.

Kenny
(Yeah, totally!)

Stan
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!

Cartman
That's not what we said.

Stan
You said Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!

Cartman
We were talking about Wales the country.

Stan
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!

Kenny
(I just want to be on TV.)

Cartman
Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.

Crewman 2
Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!

Stan
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!

Cartman
All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 

Announcer
Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die.

Stan
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 

Crewman 2
What the hell was that?!

Crewman 3
We just got rammed.

Stan
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!

Crewman 4
It's not the Japanese.

Stan
What? 

Announcer
On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.

DC Captain
You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?!  You're taking away men's livelihoods!

Stan
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.

DC Captain
You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!

Cartman
Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!

DC Crewman
Your show is fuckin' gay!

Stan
Screw this! Turn hard to port! 

Announcer
But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat block its path. 

Stan
Dude, fuck you!

DC Captain
Fuck you!

Announcer
It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging.  Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening.

Crewman 3
It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.

Cartman
Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.

Kenny
(And they're all shot.) 

Cartman
Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.

Kenny
(I would do anything!) 

Announcer
The crab-fishing reality show was doing just fine. 

DC Crew
Yeah! Woohoo! Alright! 

Announcer
But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard. 

Stan
What was that? 

Benjamin
Captain, look!

The Crew
Wow. Whoa. 

Woman 2
The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!

Stan
It's like... they know. 

DC Crewmen
Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop! 

Stan
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.

Cartman
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 

Japanese Pilot
Bonzaaaaaaaai! 

Stan
Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!

Woman 2
Look out! 

Stan
I, I can't, I can't believe it.

Cartman
Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.

Cartman
Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.

Stan
Will you stop that?

Cartman
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!

Stan
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!

Cartman
You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.

Guard
Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!' 

Emperor Akihito
So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!

Stan
You speak English.

Emperor Akihito
You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!

Cartman
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?

Kenny
(Yeah, can we go?)

Emperor Akihito
Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!

Stan
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!

Emperor Akihito
You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!

Emperor Akihito
This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. 

Cartman
What dude?

Emperor Akihito
At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all.  Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated.  Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! 

Cartman
Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.

Emperor Akihito
One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb.  It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru! 

Stan
Ummm, where did you get that picture?

Emperor Akihito
The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!

Cartman
So that's what this has all been about?

Stan
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-

Cartman
Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.

Stan
Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?

Kyle
Hello? Stan?

Stan
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.

Stan
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.

Emperor Akihito
Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!

Hatoyama
Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage! 

The Japanese
Fuck you cows!

The Japanese
Teikara chickens!

Randy
Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.

Cartman
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?

Stan
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.

Kyle
This... is exactly what I needed.

Kenny
(Meee toooo.) 

Stan
Aww! Not those guys again! 

Cartman
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 

Stan
God! Shut up!

Cartman
Piss off, you stupid assholes! 

Randy
Isn't this great food?

Gerald
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.

Randy
You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-

Father Maxi
On this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta- 

Lead Biker
Everybody's checking us out.

Biker 2
Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.

Lead Biker
Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.

Biker 3
Yeah!

Biker 2
I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, What is that?

Biker 4
Fer sure!

Biker 3
Yeah.

Biker 5
Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.

Lead Biker
That's weird.  Oh yeah, that's better.

Lead Biker
All right let's head out. 

Cartman
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.

Lead Biker
...What did you say?

Cartman
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?

Biker 6
...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!

Biker 2
Yeah! 

Cartman
No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 

Biker 7
Thah- that little boy just called us fags.

Biker 2
Like he didn't think we were cool.

Biker 6
But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?

Lead Biker
'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!

Other Bikers
Yeah! Let's ride!  Let's go! Rev 'em up! 

Ike
Fags! 

Biker 2
Did that kid just call us-?

Lead Biker
Ju-just ignore him!  God damn it, this is fucked up!

Biker 8
What's wrong with kids today? 

Biker 4
It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.

Biker 6
How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this? 

Lead Biker
I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.

Biker 3
Really? You do?

Biker 9
Whatwhat?

Lead Biker
Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!

Biker 10
Hey, that's right.

Lead Biker
That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. 

Kyle
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.

Cartman
But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 

Kyle
Oh, what the hell?! 

Biker 6
Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!

Stan
God damn it God damn it!

Lead Biker
Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads! 

Biker 2
Let's see 'em call us fags now!

Stan
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.

Kyle
Yes.

Cartman
Agreed.

Jimmy
I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.

Stan
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.

Kyle
Sounds good.

Token
Okay good, yeah.

Cartman
Ni-nice, okay.

Butters
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!

Cartman
What?

Butters
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough! Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!

Stan
...That makes perfect sense, Butters.

Butters
It does?

Stan
Yes, now get out of here.

Butters
Okay. 

Stan
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?

Cartman
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.

Stan
Oh that's good.

Cartman
Yeah, I think that'll be nice.

Stan
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?

Cartman
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.

Stan
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!

All
Yeah!

Lead Biker
Now that was a good breakfast.

Biker 6
I'm full. 

Lead Biker
You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC

Biker 6
Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!

Biker 3
What?

Biker 2
Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now! 

Biker 7
There's a little flag stuck in the shit!

Biker 11
You're fags. You've gotta be kidding me!

Lead Biker
Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this! 

Biker 12
This can't be happening. 

Stan
Really nice work, guys.

Kyle
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.

Big Gay Al
And so I said to the guy, you really think I'm paying that much?

Mr. Slave
Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. 

Big Gay Al
Oh my God. I thought we were past this.

Mayor McDaniels
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, Fags get out. Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-

Cartman
That was us!

Mayor McDaniels
...'Scuse me?

Stan
Yeah, we did that!

Kyle, Kenny
Yeah!

Mayor McDaniels
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!

Kyle
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.

Cartman
Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?

Other Kids
Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep. 

Mr. Mackey
Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!

Stan
Gay people?

Kyle
We aren't talking about gay people.

Mr. Mackey
You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!

Stan
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?

Cartman
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.

Kyle
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.

Mayor McDaniels
What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!

Stan
Aw crap!

Lead Biker
Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was an old or unpleasant woman.

Biker 2
That certainly don't apply to us.

Lead Biker
Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.

Biker 6
Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more! 

Biker 2
What's that part say there?

Lead Biker
Later, the term fag was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them baggage.

Biker 2
Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?

Lead Biker
In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.

Biker 10
Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us? 

Judge 1
We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?

Kyle
Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.

Stan
Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.

Judge 2
I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?

Stan
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?

Judge 2
No.

Stan
Then you're not a fag.

Judge 1
So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?

Cartman
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?

Stan
I don't know.

Kenny
(This is fucking ridiculous.)

Stan
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?

Judge 3
Fag.

Stan
Right. But you're not thinkin' Oh, he's a homosexual, you're thinkin' Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider.

Judge 1
This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.

Judge 4
Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?

Cartman
You call them bike-curious.

Judge 1
Bike-cu-

Stan
Bike-curious! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!

Kenny
(Jesus fucking Christ!)

Big Gay Al
Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words fag and faggot are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!

Mr. Slave
Hear hear!

Big Gay Al
We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!

Mr. Slave
Yeth Jethuth yeth!

Announcer
This is Channel 4 Evening News.

News Anchor
A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word fag. Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.

Field Reporter
And what is your name, little boy?

Martin
Martin.

Field Reporter
Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the fag for me?  Point to which one is the fag.  All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot? 

News Anchor
Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word fag officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders. 

Field Reporter
How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?

Lead Biker
What did you say?

Field Reporter
Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.

Lead Biker
Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-

Field Reporter
I already did it twice.

Lead Biker
Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.

Field Reporter
I bet I do.

Lead Biker
Well okay, I-

Field Reporter
Fag. 

News Anchor
As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... 

Randy
Fags! 

News Anchor
...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.

Cartman
Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 

Stan
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.

Kyle
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.

Mayor McDaniels
You four turd balls in my office NOW!

Stan
Aw crap! 

Mayor McDaniels
You have got me in a lot of trouble! 

Another Mayor
The fact of the matter is that fag is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!

Mayor McDaniels
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!

Kyle
We're sorry, Mayor.

Mayor McDaniels
Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!

Stan
We can fix this!

Mayor McDaniels
HOW?!

Stan
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.

Cartman
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.

Lead Biker
Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of fag from gay people to us, then soon every town might.  If we don't do anythng, we can end up trying to fight e-  If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett!  I'm trying to talk, you fag!  Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now!  We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass! 

Field Reporter
Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word fag will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, fag will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.

Big Gay Al
You can do it, boys! We believe in you!

Field Reporter
And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. 

Cartman
Emmanuel Lewis, huh?

Stan
Ohh, it all makes sense now. 

Emmanuel Lewis
To change...  the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word fag to be both discerning and undisputable.

Big Gay Al
Come on boys, you can do it! 

Randy
Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 

Stan
There's fags everywhere!

Kyle
We gotta run! 

Emmanuel Lewis
WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast! 

Lead Biker
Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?

Stan
Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 

Kyle
Yeah. You definitely made your point.

Biker 13
No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!

Stan
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.

Lead Biker
No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!

Stan
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.

Kyle
I don't either.

Butters
That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.

Biker 14
Who is this little fag?

Butters
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.

Biker 15
That's it, let's kill them all!

Cartman
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!

Big Gay Al
No one is killing anyone!  We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!

Lead Biker
All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And yo know what? We like it.

Biker 2
Yeah, we like being fags.

Lead Biker
So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell Faggots! All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say Hello, fags. No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?

Bikers
That's right. You got it. Yeah. 

Biker 6
Come on, fags, let's roll out! 

Stan
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.

Emmanuel Lewis
Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced. 

Stan
We did it! Yeah!

Kyle
Yeah! We did it, you guys! 

Cartman
Oh it's over, it's finally over! 

Stan
Today, we've made history.

Student
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements, Parent-teacher conferences begin next Thursday. If you have not yet done so, please turn in your parents' requested time sheets by the end of fifth period today.  Lunch today will be a choice of chicken tostadas or spaghetti with a marninara sauce and side salad.  Attention fourth graders: the fall registration for glee club starts tomorrow. Any interested students should fill out a-  Whoa, what's going on?

Intruder
I'll killl you!  I swear to God I'll kill you!

Student
Who are you?!

Intruder
I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!

Student
Hey! He's got a gun!

Intruder
You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!

Student
Sir, please, I don't know you.

Intruder
Yeah, right!

Man
All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- 

Student
Oh God, he shot him!

Intruder
Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!

Student
HAAAAAAAAAA! Sir, I clearly don't know-  th-AAAAA! AAAA!

Intruder
There! How's it feel, huh?!

Student
Please, I don't know you! Uughuh!

Intruder
You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!

Gordon
No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!

Intruder
Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!

Gordon
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

Intruder
I said do it! 

Gordon
AAAAA! AAAAA! AAAAAAAAAA! AAA! Any, any interested students should fill out an applicant survey  WAA! WAAAAAAAAAA!

Intruder
I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!

Gordon
No please! I'm so scared!   I'm so scared!

Intruder
DO IT!

Gordon
Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here!  I got my mouth on the ba- 

Intruder
Look at you now. We're all dead. 

Mr. Mackey
We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.

Cartman
Oh. My. Goodddd.

Cartman
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?

Boy
Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.

Mr. Mackey
Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 

Cartman
He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?

Casey
My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade.  Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves? Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job. 

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?

Casey
I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.

Mr. Mackey
M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? 

Mr. Mackey
M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.

Cartman
Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?

Mr. Mackey
What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!

Cartman
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?

Mr. Mackey
Get lost, you little dirtball!

Casey
Excuse me?

Mr. Mackey
I said take a hike!

Casey
I don't understand... what I did wrong.

Mr. Mackey
Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 

Cartman
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.

Butters
Oh jeez!

Cartman
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!

Kyle
Will somebody shut him up?

Cartman
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?

Principal Victoria
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.

Cartman
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!

Principal Victoria
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.

Cartman
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!

Mr. Mackey
Well, because he was being murdered.

Cartman
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!

Principal Victoria
All we ask is you keep it shorter.

Cartman
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!

Cartman
Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.

Third Graders
I pledge allegiance to the flag -

Cartman
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -

Kindergartners
#NAME?
Cartman
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.

Kyle
Oh God, no! 

Cartman
Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.

Ike
NOOO!

Cartman
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.

Butters
Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?

Wendy
Is what true?

Butters
That you hate Smurfs?

Wendy
I don't have time for this.

Butters
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!

Melvins
Yeah, that's right. We can ask. 

Wendy
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!

Butters
It is true!

Melvin 1
Oh my God!

Melvin 2
Yeah, bemememe

Melvin 3
Oh my God!

Wendy
Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 

Butters
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.

Casey
Hyeah.

Melvin 1
That was cool.

Melvin 4
Awesome

Melvin 2
Yeah, that was cool.

Melvin 3
Yeah, great job.

Cartman
Thank you and this is to..?

Douglas
Douglas.

Cartman
To Douglas. There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.

Butters
Hey Eric!

Cartman
Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?

Butters
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?

Cartman
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.

Butters
Cool, thanks.

Cartman
That'll be five dollars.

Butters
Oh, okay. 

Stan
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

Cartman
A book signing.

Stan
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!

Cartman
I do not directly say she's a slut!

Stan
Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end!

Cartman
You didn't read the rest, dude.

Stan
Or does she?

Cartman
Or does she? See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!

Butters
Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!

Boy 1
Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings? 

Stan
Hey hey, stop reading that!

Boy 1
Wull what do you mean?

Stan
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!

Boy 2
Yes it does!

Casey
Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller. 

Stan
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?

Wendy
I really don't care, Stan.

Stan
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.

Wendy
I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 

Cartman
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?

Principal Victoria
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.

Cartman
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?

Mr. Mackey
Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?

Cartman
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!

Mr. Mackey
Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-

Cartman
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!

Principal Victoria
Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!

Cartman
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 

Announcer
Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.

Cartman
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 

Butters
Whoa... 

Cartman
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.

Kyle
These, are the morning announcements. 

Cartman
Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.

Cartman Smurf
No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?!  I should have known. Wendy!

Human Wendy
Out of my way! 

Cartman Smurf
Wendy, what are you doing here?!

Human Wendy
Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.

Cartman Smurf
Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!

Human Wendy
Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! 

Cartman Smurf
How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!

Human Wendy
You can suck my fat tits too! 

Cartman Smurf
Smurfette noooo!

Human Wendy
Suck mah fat tits!

Cartman
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?

Butters
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!

A Melvin
I can no longer stand idly by.

Butters
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!

Casey
It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.

Melvins
Yeah!

Butters
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 

Butters
Let us not forget what happens this day!

A Melvin
Woo on!

Butters
We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 

Melvin 2
Take that, school president!

Melvin 3
Get her good!

Butters
I am.

Wendy
Hey, what are you doing?

Butters
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!

Mr. Testaburger
What the hell? 

Butters
Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!

Mr. Testaburger
Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered? 

Wendy
It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.

Cartman
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.

Wendy
Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.

Cartman
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.

Wendy
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?

Cartman
Of course. That's why we're here.

A Boy
Five seconds. 

Cartman
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.

Wendy
Sure.

Cartman
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.

Wendy
Okay.

Cartman
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 

Wendy
I don't, I, I have no idea what-

Cartman
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.

Butters
Ohhh, he's got her now!

Cartman
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?

Wendy
I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-

Cartman
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 

Butters
She's speechless!

Cartman
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?

Wendy
Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.

Cartman
Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?

Wendy
What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?

Cartman
What? What do you mean I know that?

Wendy
I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?

Cartman
No! You wiped them all out!

Wendy
Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!

Cartman
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?

Wendy
No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.

Stan
What?!

Wendy
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.

Butters
All right! Cartman's president. We did it.

A Melvin
I'm confused.

Cartman
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-

Wendy
No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.

Cartman
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!

Wendy
Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.

Cartman
You sold the movie rights to who?!

Wendy
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.

Cartman
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!

Cartman
Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 

Cartman
Huh!

Stan
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?

Cartman
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!

Kyle
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.

Cartman
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 

Casey
The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy? Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.

Cartman
I'm doin' the best I can! 

Cartman
We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.

Stan
Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 

Cartman
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.

Butters
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.

Cartman
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.

Jimmy
Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?

Cartman
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.

Stan
We're here! It's the water park! 

Randy
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?

Cartman
Come on, let's go!

Stan
We got it, Dad.

Cartman
Six adorable children please.

Cartman
Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 

Kyle
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?

Stan
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?

Cartman
Forget it! Just forget it! 

Stan
Dude, this is awesome.

Kyle
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?

Butters
Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 

Kyle
Okay, go ahead. 

Butters
Okay, thanks. 

Kyle
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?

Stan
Okay.

Kyle
All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!

Butters
You said go ahead.

Stan
Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.

Kyle
No dude, Butters' pee is in there.

Stan
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.

Butters
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.

Kyle
No they don't!

Stan
Yeah, they do, Kyle.

Jimmy
To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.

Kyle
Dude!

Stan
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.

Kyle
NO!

Cartman
What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!

Ride operator
Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-

Cartman
Just do it in English!

Cartman
There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).

Stan
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?

Butters
You bet!

Kyle
I'm not getting back in the water.

Stan
Aw come on, Kyle.

Kyle
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?

Stan
Not everybody pees in pools.

Kyle
Do you pee in the pool?

Stan
Not today... yet.

Kyle
Aw, come on!

Stan
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?

Kyle
Most likely.

Cartman
You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!

Stan
Dude, where have you been?

Cartman
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!

Kyle
So what?

Cartman
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!

Kyle
Well then they're not minorities, are they?

Cartman
...What do you mean?

Kyle
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!

Cartman
The black and brown people.

Kyle
No, you're the minority!

Cartman
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!

Stan
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.

Cartman
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!

Butters
The who?

Cartman
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!

Stan
I'm gonna go on the slides.

Butters
Whoopie! 

Cartman
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?

Kyle
Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 

Elderly Woman
Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?

Elderly Man
Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.

Kyle
Eewww! 

Water Tester
Oh my God.

Pi Pi
Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you.

Assistant
Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.

Water Tester
I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now ninety eight percent pee.

Pi Pi
Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?

Assistant
Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent.  You have to shut down.

Pi Pi
What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggesteh weekend. Everyone is having uhtheh fun.

Water Tester
You're endangering people's lives!  If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!

Lawyer
And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?

Water Tester
One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!

Pi Pi
Gehntlemen, pleaseh. I come-a from ada Venice.  Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.

Water Tester
You have to evacuate people now!

Lawyer
He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!

Water Tester
If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. 

Butters
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!

Stan
This is sweet, huh Kenny? 

Jimmy
What what's that? 

Man 1
It's pee! 

Man 2
Look out for the pee! 

Kyle
Aaaaah! Gross! 

Pi Pi
Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! 

Floating Man
Aaaah!

Stan
Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

Kyle
Aw, sick! 

Fire Marshal
I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. 

Randy
What's going on?

Fire Marshal
I told you people to keep civilians back!

Randy
Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?

Fire Marshal
We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-

Officer 1
Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. 

Water Tester
We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.

Fire Marshal
So this is all pee-related.

Water Tester
Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.

Fire Marshal
And?

Water Tester
It was almost all pee, no H.

Randy
Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 

Fire Marshal
Stay back!

Randy
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!

Officer 2
Sir, it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out.

Water Tester
I think that would be a very bad idea.

Fire Marshal
And why is that?

Water Tester
Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.

Fireman 1
Change how?

Water Tester
All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey.  We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. 

Fire Marshal
My God, he's become full of rage!

Kyle
Aahhh...

Stan
Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!

Kyle
No way!

Jimmy
You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.

Butters
Come on, Kyle!

Kyle
Dude, that's all pee!

Stan
Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!

Kyle
I'll die if I do swim in it!

Stan
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!

Kyle
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!

Stan
...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.

Kyle
...What?!

Stan
Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.

Kyle
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!

Stan
Not... all the time.

Kyle
That is gross!!

Stan
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!

Butters
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 

Stan
Kyle, come on!

Kyle
Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 

Butters
Do you need to wash your hands?

Cartman
Help! Help!

Man 1
Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! 

Cartman
Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 

Man 2
Are you okay?

Cartman
Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.

Man 2
Well what are we gonna do now?

Woman 1
We've gotta just wait it out.

Woman 2
Yeah, but for how long?

Man 3
We need to find somethin' to paddle with.

Cartman
Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 

Sharon
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.

Randy
It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!

Sharon
What is all pee?

Randy
Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.

Sharon
What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!

Randy
I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.

Sharon
Randy, you've got to do something!

Randy
Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.

Fire Marshal
I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands!  Damn it where is that antidote?!

Researcher 1
Here! Here! We think we have it, sir!  It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.

Fire Marshal
All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! 

Water Tester
Let's hope to Christ this works.  No, damn it, no!

Fire Marshal
They're still angry.

Researcher 1
This one's really angry.

Fire Marshal
It's out of control!  Find an antidote that works! 

Kyle
Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?

Stan
I don't know. 

Pi Pi
Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them. 

Stan
Who are you?

Pi Pi
Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.

Kyle
Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!

Pi Pi
But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.

Jimmy
Okay, w-where's the maintenance room?

Pi Pi
That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? 

Kyle
No.

Butters
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.

Kyle
Not in pee!

Pi Pi
Please-a you have to hurry!  I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.

Kyle
Oh who pees in the shower?

Stan
...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.

Butters
Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.

Kyle
You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!

Pi Pi
Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!

Kyle
Jesus Christ!

Cartman
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world? When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 

Teacher
All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.

Cartman
I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.

Teacher
Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!

Cartman
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.

Teacher
Good.

Cartman
Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.

Señor Lopez
You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?

Cartman
Well, I do just as much work.

Señor Lopez
You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.

Cartman
Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.

Coucilman
All those in favor of putting white people in camps?

Audience
Aye!

Coucilman
All those opposed?

Cartman
Noooo...

Coucilman
The minorities win! 

Cartman
NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 

Pi Pi
Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.

Kyle
Let's just get this over with!

Pi Pi
You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?

Kyle
Yes.

Pi Pi
Good-a. Now just one last thing.  You need to drink-a some pee.

Kyle
What?!

Pi Pi
You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.

Kyle
Why?!

Pi Pi
You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.

Stan
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?

Kyle
I am not, not, d-rinking pee!

Pi Pi
But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!

Stan
Just drink the pee, Kyle.

Butters
Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.

Pi Pi
What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!

Kyle
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.

Pi Pi
Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.

Kyle
No!

Water Tester
Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.

Researcher 2
Wait, you mean a banana.

Water Tester
Yes.

Fire Marshal
Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey!  All right, Connors. 

Fireman 2
Holy God, it works!

Police Captain
All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-

Water Tester
Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.

Randy
I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 

Fire Marshal
You sure you want to do this?

Randy
Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.

Researcher 3
He looks agitated...

Randy
Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.

Fire Marshal
He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! 

Randy
No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.

Water Tester
He's all right!

Fireman 3
The banana worked!

Stan
Come on, dude!

Kyle
I'm thinking about it!

Jimmy
Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.

Pi Pi
There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! 

Kyle
Gah, ah.  Gaagh.

Pi Pi
Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.

Butters
You can do it, Kyle!

Kyle
Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 

Pi Pi
All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a 

Butters
Hey look! 

Randy
Stan! 

Stan
All right, they finally came for us. 

Kyle
Are you fucking kidding me?! 

Randy
Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 

Cartman
Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!

Butters
Hawww, you lived?

Cartman
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?

Kyle
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!

Cartman
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!

Kyle
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!

Stan
Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.

Kyle
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!

Water Tester
All right everyone, quick! Here you go!

Butters
What's this?

Fire Marshal
You all need to eat your banana immediately!

Kyle
What the hell for?!

Stevens
Eat the banana or we have to put you down!

Kyle
AAAAAAAA!

Character
Line
Man
Put it down, you bitch!

Man
Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! 

Woman
You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 

Tiger
You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!

Elin
Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!

Tiger
God, shut up!  Shut! Up!  Where are my fucking pills?! 

Elin
Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!

Tiger
Will you just listen to me?!

Elin
Listen to this-a! 

Tiger
Aaaah!  You fucking whore!

Elin
Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!

Tiger
I'm getting the fuck away from you! 

Elin
Open the door, you motherfucker! 

Cartman
Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 

Stan
What are you guys doing?

Cartman
Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 

Tiger
D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!

Cartman
Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 

Tiger
Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!

Elin
It serves you right, you cheating turd! 

Cartman
Oh dude, was that a combo move?

Kenny
(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)

Cartman
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.

Kyle
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.

Cartman
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.

Chairman
I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it.  Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?

Expert 1
Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people.

Expert 2
Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women? 

Chairman
Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit!  I want answers!

Expert 3
We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.

Chairman
Sex awhowho?

Expert 4
It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners. 

Expert 5
Definitely true.

Chairman
Yes, we all know that, go on.

Expert 4
But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.

Expert 6
But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love? 

Chairman
What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?

Expert 7
It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming.

Expert 8
Or cooling.

Expert 9
Yes

Expert 7
If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children

Chairman
That does it!  I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.

Expert 9
Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms.  I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture.  And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go. 

The class
Oh! Wow. Ohhh.

Kenny
(Woo hoo!)

Kyle
Jesus, dude.

Butters
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.

Expert 9
Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.

Butters
I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??

Expert 9
Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?

Butters
Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??

Expert 9
Very good, turn your answers over please. 

Butters
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!

Expert 9
Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered What handkerchief?  A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. 

Kyle
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?

Kenny
(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)

Expert 9
I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.

Kyle
What?!

Butters
Oh no!

Kenny
(Who fuckin' cares?)

Expert 9
We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.

Kyle
Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?

Expert 9
Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.

Butters
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?

Kyle
So what happens to us now?

Expert 9
A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation.

Kenny
(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)

Expert 9
I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.

Kenny
(Really??)

Butters
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.

Chairman
Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?

Dr. Tonton
In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, What handkerchief?

Chairman
We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them.  They're leading lives of secret pain.

Reporter 1
And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?

Chairman
It appears so.

Reporter 1
The poor bastards!

Reporter 2
But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?

Chairman
We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities.  However, we are still collecting data, and all-

Randy
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?

Chairman
-answers which we all desire.  Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it! 

Mrs. McCormick
Kenny, it's time for dinner!  Kenny?  AAAA!

Priest
Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.

Kyle
Oh God, it's true.

Priest
But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-

Butters
There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..

Kyle
Butters! Butters, stop it!

Butters
But this is what I keep seeing in my head!

Kyle
Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!

Butters
No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.

Kyle
No! Butters, stop! 

Butters
Haah! Leave me alone! 

Kyle
Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!

Commentator
Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.

Elin
You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 

Tiger
Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it! 

Elin
How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!

Stan
Aw dude, I clocked you!

Cartman
I told you this game was sweet, dude.

Stan
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 

Cartman
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?

Stan
Hit A and X together.

Announcer
Round 2. Fight!! 

Cartman
Oh, you're going down, Elin!

Stan
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.

Announcer
Pre-nup power-up. 

Cartman
Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?

Therapist
All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall?  Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!

David Letterman
Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.

Therapist
Sex with employees. Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton.

Bill Clinton
Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?

Therapist
Very good, Billy.  cigars in vaginas. Not the best idea there.

Charlie Sheen
Watching Internet porn all day every day?

Therapist
Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive  Internet porn. Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.

Kyle
Hello?

The men
Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.

Therapist
And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?

Kyle
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.

Bill Clinton
Does your mom have big tits?

Therapist
Billy!

Bill Clinton
Sorry...

Butters
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.

Ben Roethlisberger
I heard that.

Butters
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?

Therapist
Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!

David Duchovny
Aw, gee whiz!

Expert 4
To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees.  You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here.  An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money.  Go ahead. 

Chairman
My God...

Expert 4
Yes...  The subject is now isolated and shunned.

Chairman
Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?

Expert 4
Making a public apology on its talk show. 

Therapist
Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid?  Yes, Tiger?

Tiger Woods
Avoid drugs? And alcohol?

The other men
Auugh!

Therapist
No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it.  In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?

Michael Douglas
Caught.

Therapist
Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!

The Men
Getting caught.

Therapist
Very good! You are all here in therapy  because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?

Ben Rothlisberger
Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?

David Letterman
When they uh ask you for money, pay them.

Therapist
Good, yes!

Kyle
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 

Bill Clinton
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

Kyle
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 

Therapist
Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.

Chairman
Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.

Obama
So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.

Chairman
No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction.

Obama
You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??

Chairman
Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this.  Independence Hall.

Obama
The birthplace of our country.

Chairman
We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.

Obama
Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.

Chairman
And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!

Obama
It's the only explanation that makes any sense. 

Tiger
I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-

Elin
You motherfucker!

Tiger
Oh no!

Elin
I should have never married  youuu! 

Tiger
Agh! Stop it!

Elin
A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! 

Cartman
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??

Stan
Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.

Kyle
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?

Therapist
We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!

Butters
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.

Therapist
Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.

Kyle
...As soon as what's dead? 

Therapist
The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!

SWAT Officer 1
Entrance is clear, Mr. President. 

Chairman
Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.

SWAT Officer 2
Right side clear!

Expert 4
We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.

Obama
Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.

Expert 10
Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.

Obama
Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.

SWAT Officer 2
Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can.  I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar. 

Obama
We have a turd in the punch bowl.

Secret Service Agent
Turd in the punch bowl. 

SWAT Officer 2
Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on.  Where are you takin' me?

News 4 Reporter
Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country. 

SWAT Officer 3
Mr. President, here they are. 

Therapist
This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.

Chairman
Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?

Kyle
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.

Chairman
A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!

Obama
Quick, give that boy a gun! 

Kyle
What?

SWAT Officer 3
You'd better take one too. 

Obama
Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. 

Kyle
What bastard?

Obama
The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh- 

Chairman
The hell was that?

SWAT Officer 4
I got a baaad feelin' about this. 

Dr. Tonton
Oh my God there it is!

Chairman
It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it! 

Obama
Shoot it boys!

Expert 6
You have to shoot it! 

Chairman
Shoot it again, it's still alive! 

SWAT Officer 5
You gotta reload! 

Expert 4
Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart! 

Obama
Keep shooting it!

Expert 11
Shoot him in his blabber mouth! 

Chairman
My God, they've done it!

Bill Clinton
Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!

David Letterman
I can feel it! I'm free!

Another addict
We are healed!

Obama
We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. 

Randy
Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 

News 4 Reporter
We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?

Kyle
I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 

Butters
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.

Tiger
I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf.

Cartman
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!

Stan
Yeah, where's all the fighting?

Cartman
Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!

Stan
Yeah, golf is stupid again. 

Mr. Garrison
Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.

Cartman
Aww, books? God, I hate those!

Mr. Garrison
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 

Cartman
Oh really? Sweet.

Mr. Garrison
It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... 

Stan
All right!

Mr. Garrison
...and strong vulgar language...

Kenny
(Awesome, dude!)

Mr. Garrison
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.

Cartman
Oho man, I can't wait!

Mr. Garrison
Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-

Cartman
No on, come on, let's read it now!

Kyle
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?

Mr. Garrison
Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 

Cartman
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!

Mr. Garrison
You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!

Class
Awww!

Stan
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?

Kyle
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.

Stan
I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said shit and fuck a few times.

Kyle
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 

Cartman
Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming, and then after like a hundred pages I was like alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end, and then I got to the last page, and I was all the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!

Kyle
Why the hell was this book banned?!

Cartman
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 

Kenny
(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)

Cartman
We know, we were just saying that.

Stan
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?

Butters
Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?

Stephen
John Lennon's dead, Butters.

Butters
Aww. Dangit. 

Kyle
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.

Cartman
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!

Stan
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 

Cartman
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.

Kyle
Yeah, sweet.

Kenny
(Awesome.)

Kyle
The Tale of... 

Cartman
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.

Kenny
(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)

Kyle
Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...

Cartman
It was a... a warm spring morning. 

Sharon
The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs?  It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his...  Ew. He took a...  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! He then grabbed his dog's  Ehohoh, oh my God! Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 

Sharon
Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!

Randy
Read what?

Sharon
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!

Randy
So?

Sharon
Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!

Randy
Huh?

Sharon
I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!

Randy
It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi- Ew, Sharon, gross!

Sharon
Nono, just keep reading.

Randy
He took a- and then- Oh, man. Oh, this- 

Sharon
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.

Randy
Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!

Sharon
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!

Randy
Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu- What? He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-  That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest. Oh... Oh, man.

Sharon
Well?

Randy
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.

Sharon
Right? It's not just me.

Randy
No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!

Sharon
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.

Randy
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.

Cartman
Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!

Stan
Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!

Cartman
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.

Stan
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!

Kyle
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!

Cartman
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!

Stan
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!

Cartman
Butters, what are you up to?

Butters
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians

Kim
Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!

Butters
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.

Stan
Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!

Butters
I am?

Cartman
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.

Butters
Oh no. Which book was that?

Cartman
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!

Butters
I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!

Sharon
Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.

Sheila
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.

Stan
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 

Cartman
That's right.

Randy
Butters? Is that true?

Butters
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.

Gerald
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.

Butters
Huh?

Kyle
What? 

Gerald
Yeah, it's really amazing.

Butters
Oh, thanks.

Sheila
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.

Mr. Needlebaum
Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.

Stan
Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!

Kyle
Yeah, we wrote that!

Randy
Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.

Kyle
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.

Butters
I wrote that. 

Stephen
Really amazing.

Stan
What? Hey! 

News Anchor
It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called literary genius. The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting.

News Anchor
The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.

News Anchor
The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold Butters Stotch. 

Clyde
Hey, here he comes!

Mr. Adler
Amazing book, Butters. 

Butters
Thank you! 

Mrs. Streibel
You've changed my life, young man.

Butters
That's nice. 

Cartman
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!

Butters
Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?

Kyle
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!

Butters
But, you told me I did!

Stan
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 

Red
Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.

Lola
He's so brooding and full of angst.

Butters
Yeah, I'm broooding.

Cartman
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!

Rebecca
Oh God, you guys are pathetic!

Lola
Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. 

Stan
God-damnit!

Kyle
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-

Butters
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!

Cartman
That inconsiderate jerk!

Announcer
Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook  And Not Vomit?  The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times.  Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?

Broderick
Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.

Announcer
Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? 

Matt Lauer
Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.

Stephen
Hello Matt

Linda
Hi everyone.

Matt Lauer
You must be pretty proud of your son.

Stephen
Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.

Meredith Vieira
And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?

Stephen
Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.

Butters
I have to come right to my room after school.

Stephen
But we are very very proud nonetheless.

Al Roker
Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?

Butters
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.

Matt Lauer
All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?

Butters
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.

Meredith Vieira
Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? 

Al Roker
Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?

Butters
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.

Al Roker
Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.

Butters
Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.

Stan
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!

Assemblyman 1
That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.

Cartman
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!

Assemblyman 2
You just fail to understand what the author meant.

Kyle
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!

Assemblyman 3
No, no no, that's such a simplistic view.

Stan
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!

Assemblywoman 1
Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?

Kyle
Yes!

Assemblywoman 1
But what would be the point?

Cartman
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!

Assemblywoman 2
No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.

Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Yes they would!

Assemblywoman 2
It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.

Stan
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!

Assemblyman 2
Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.

Stan
What?

Assemblywoman 2
Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!

Assemblyman 2
What book did you read?!

Stan
There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!

Assemblyman 4
Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? 

Field Reporter
Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. 

Field Reporter
Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?

Butters
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!

Field Reporter
Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?

Butters
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!

Stephen
Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!

Butters
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 

Stan
I can't believe they won't ban our book!

Kyle
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!

Kenny
(It's fucking disgusting!)

Cartman
All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.

Kyle
What?! 

Cartman
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.

Kyle
Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 

Cartman
Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.

Stan
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 

Cartman
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.

Kenny
(Okay.)

Cartman
Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 

Matt
Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.

Meredith
Al, how is it out there?

Al
I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel.  And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.

Meredith
Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.

Matt
That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.

Morgan Freeman
The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, I need to poop. Okay, Rebecca replied, I like poop. Douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.  Chapter 2...

Cartman
See any hunters yet?

Kenny
(Not yet) 

Cartman
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.

Kyle
Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!

Kenny
(Huh?)

Kyle
Butters wrote a second book!

Cartman
So what?

Stan
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!

Kyle
We can get people to believe us now!

Cartman
Oh dude, sweet! 

Morgan Freeman
Why are we here? Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.

Shopper 1
The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs.

Shopper 2
And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt.

Stan
Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 

Cartman
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!

Shopper 3
Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?

Marsha
So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.

Shopper 4
I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.

Cartman
What?!

Stan
You can't be serious! You people like this?!

Shopper 5
Some of the imagery is unbelievable

Kyle
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!

Shopper 6
Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh?  Didn't like what the book had to say?

Marsha
What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!

Cartman
Oh come on!

Stan
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!

Shopper 7
And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end.  Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!

Kim
Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.

The Kardashians
Yaaay!

Male Guest
Can I go with you girls? 

News Anchor 2
Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold Butters Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians..  wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book.

News Anchor 2
Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! 

Cartman
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.

Butters
I know.

Stan
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!

Butters
You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!

Kyle
Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.

Stan
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.

Butters
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.

Cartman
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.

Butters
What?

Cartman
You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.

Butters
What?! Oh no!

Cartman
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 

Butters
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 

Group
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.

Cartman
Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.

Coach
You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.

Cartman
I know, it sucks. 

Coach
Alright kids, practice is over for today.

Cartman
KFC!! 

Cartman
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!

Kyle
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!

Cartman
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!

Stan
Hey it looks different.

Randy
Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?

Customer
Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. 

Stan
A what?

Cartman
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!

Kyle
So where's the KFC now?

Randy
Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 

Clerk
Can I help you sir?

Randy
Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?

Clerk
Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.

Randy
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?

Clerk
Sure. New state laws say it's okay.

Randy
Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!

Clerk
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.

Randy
My huh?

Clerk
Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.

Randy
Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 

Stan
What'd they say?

Randy
KFC's gone, been replaced.

Cartman
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!

Randy
Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 

Stan
The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.

Randy
I gotta get to the doctor! 

Kyle
...so no KFC?

Cartman
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!

Dr. Doctor
Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.

Randy
All right!

Dr. Doctor
Yep, you check out fine.

Randy
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?

Dr. Doctor
For what?

Randy
Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.

Dr. Doctor
Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.

Randy
But you said I'm totally healthy!

Dr. Doctor
Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!

Randy
...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?

Dr. Doctor
Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.

Randy
Yeah, but what's the quickest way?

Dr. Doctor
The what?

Randy
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?

Cartman
Mom, drive faster!

Liane
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.

Cartman
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!

Liane
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?

Cartman
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!

Liane
Alright honey, let's take it easy.

Cartman
Fuck you!

Cartman
No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 

Worker 1
It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.

Cartman
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!

Worker 1
Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.

Cartman
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!

Worker 2
No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.

Cartman
Nooooooooo-! 

Stan
Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.

Randy
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 

Clerk 2
Can I help you?

Cartman
I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 

Clerk 2
Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-

Cartman
Really?

Clerk 2
-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. 

Cartman
Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!

Clerk 2
This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.

Cartman
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!

Clerk 2
If you don't want it, that's fine-

Cartman
NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.

Randy
Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers. Alright.  Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...  slow-growing and can take years to develop. Dammit.  Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive. Oh this is good. There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?

Randy
Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!

Sharon
Wha... WAAAAA! 

Dr. Doctor
Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.

Randy
SCORE! 

Dr. Doctor
Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-

Randy
Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!

Dr. Doctor
Your prescription for what?

Randy
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...

Randy
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!

Randy
Uh that is nice! That is nice!

Jimbo
Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!

Randy
I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?

Jimbo
No, I mean, your actual balls!

Randy
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 

Tough Boy 1
Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.

Cartman
Yeah. Who isn't?

Tough Boy 1
Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.

Cartman
Billy Miller? Seriously??

Billy
Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?

Cartman
Tommy said you have some KFC.

Billy
Suuure.  Jessie. 

Cartman
Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!

Billy
I have my sources. That'll be $85.

Cartman
85 bucks?? I don't have that! 

Billy
Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.

Cartman
How much KFC are we talking?

Billy
Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.

Cartman
Holy fuck, dude.

Billy
I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?

Cartman
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?

Billy
Excellent.

Randy
Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 

Cartman
Are you Teabag?

Teabag
Maybe I am. Who's askin'?

Cartman
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?

Teabag
Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  Alright, we're in biz.  It's all there, man.

Cartman
Extra crispy? 

Teabag
'Course, man, I ain't no fool.

Cartman
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!

Teabag
Awww, it's all the same shit, man.

Cartman
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 

Teabag
Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... 

Cartman
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!

Teabag
I'll take back the gravy.

Cartman
Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!

Teabag
AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! 

Barbrady
What's going on back there?

Cartman
Nothin', it's cool.

Jimbo
Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.

Randy
Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.

Nelson
Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.

Randy
No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.

Player 1
Aw some on, just give us a little bit.

Player 2
Yeah.

Randy
Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.

Nelson
Women love huge balls?

Randy
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going whaaa? I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 

Woman 1
Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? 

Randy
See?

Billy
Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?

Cartman
Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 

Billy
Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!

Cartman
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 

Billy
That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little arrangement with the Colonel himself.

Cartman
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?

Billy
That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?

Cartman
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?

Billy
Excellent.

Nurse
Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. 

Dr. Doctor
What the hell is going on?

Nurse
Doctor?

Dr. Doctor
This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.

Jimbo
Heh, I am stoned off my ass!

Player 3
I'm stoned off my balls! 

Randy
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?

Woman 2
Wow. Those guys have nice balls.

Woman 3
Wish my man had balls like those.

Woman 2
Mmm.

The Colonel
Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.

Tommy
We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?

Cartman
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.

The Colonel
I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where's he go?

The Colonel
Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. 

Cartman
Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.

The Colonel
And how do I know you're not a liar too?

Cartman
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!

The Colonel
I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.

Cartman
Good.

The Colonel
Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. 

Sharon
Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.

Randy
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.

Sharon
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 

Randy
Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?

Sharon
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-

Randy
Hey. My eyes are up here.

Sharon
I'm sorry, I just...

Randy
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 

Randy
Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?

Clerk
I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.

Randy
Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?

Clerk
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.

Randy
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?

Billy
What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!

Cartman
Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!

Billy
...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!

Cartman
Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!

Billy
How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!

Cartman
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.

Billy
What is that supposed to mean?

Cartman
I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.

Billy
You wouldn't do that.

Cartman
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?

Billy's Mom
Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!

Cartman
Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.

Randy
What do we want?

Men
Bigger doors!

Randy
Where do we want them?

Men
Weed stores!

Randy
What do we want?

Men
Bigger doors!

Randy
Where do we want them?

Men
Weed stores!

Clerk
Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.

Man 1
Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.

Man 2
Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.

Clerk
Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.

Man 3
What's ridiculous about it?

Dr. Doctor
Hold on, hold people people, please!  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!

Tough Boy 2
Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.

Cartman
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!

Tough Boy 3
Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.

Cartman
What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.

The Colonel
Hello. Hello??

Cartman
Colonel, how are you doing?

The Colonel
What happened?

Cartman
Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 

The Colonel
Eric, what happened??

Cartman
We had a little problem.

The Colonel
I heard.

Cartman
Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?

The Colonel
Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!

Cartman
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.

The Colonel
There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!

Cartman
Hey, take it easy Colonel.

The Colonel
I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!

Cartman
Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 

Barbrady
Freeze!

Henchman
It's the cops! 

Billy's Mom
Run Billy, run! 

Billy
Mommy, no!

Barbrady
Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. 

Dr. Doctor
And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. 

Randy
Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 

Sharon
Yeah. Great.

Randy
Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 

Sharon
Randy, I love it! 

Randy
And when it gets cold it shrinks. 

Woman 4
Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?

Sharon
Yyyup!

Woman 5
Luckyyyyy!

Cartman
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!

Kyle
How the hell do you have more friends than me?

Cartman
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.

Kyle
How many friends do you have, Kenny?

Kenny
(Sixty two)

Kyle
What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?

Stan
Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?

Cartman
Stupid Facebok stuff.

Stan
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.

Kyle
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.

Stan
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?

Cartman
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.

Kyle
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 

Cartman
Surprise! 

Stan
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!

Kyle
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!

Kenny
(Yeah!)

Stan
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!

Cartman
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy

Stan
Who?

Cartman
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.

Kyle
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.

Stan
You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. 

Kyle
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.

Kip
Ahhhhh.  Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! 

Kip
Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!

Kip's Mom
Kip, really?

Kip's Dad
You did?

Kip
Yeah!! 

Kip's Dad
Huh son, that's wonderful.

Kip's Mom
What's his name?

Kip
Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading.

Kip's Mom
Oh, is he a nice boy?

Kip
Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! 

Randy
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?

Stan
Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.

Randy
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?

Stan
No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.

Randy
...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?

Stan
...Dad, you are my friend.

Randy
...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?

Stan
Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!

Randy
Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?

Stan
I just wanna do my homework!

Randy
Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?

Stan
Alright, Dad, I'll add you!

Randy
Oh cool! Okay. 

Kip
Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!

Kip's Mom
That's great, Kip!

Kip
Yeah! 

Kip's Dad
They sure are getting to know each other.

Kip's Mom
I'ts amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?

Kip's Dad
His friend lives on a farm?

Kyle
I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 

Wendy
Am I a joke to you?

Stan
What?

Wendy
I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?

Stan
...Um, no?

Wendy
You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!

Stan
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-

Wendy
Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?

Stan
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-

Wendy
You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!

Stan
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.

Wendy
And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to In a relationship!

Stan
How?

Wendy
By editing your profile under basic information!

Stan
Okay, I'm sorry!

Stan
Edit profile. Basic... settings Jesus Christ!

Randy
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?

Stan
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!

Randy
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!

Stan
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.

Randy
That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 

Stan
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?

Cartman
Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.

Kyle
Can I come in?

Stan
Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?

Kyle
I... don't... have... any... friends...

Stan
What?

Kyle
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.

Stan
Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.

Kyle
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?

Stan
NO.

Kyle
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!

Stan
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!

Kyle
You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!

Stan
Ah fuck.

Stan
Okay it says I'm at your farm.

Kyle
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...

Stan
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.

Kyle
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!

Kip's Dad
So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?

Kip
Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year.

Kip's Mom
Oh, what'd he say about those?

Kip
He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!

Kip's Dad
Sounds like you boys had a ball!

Kip
Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?

Kip's Dad
Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.

Kip's Mom
I thnk the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.

Kip
Wow, thanks! 

Kip's Mom
Have fun and be safe! 

Kip
Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too.  Hahaa haha! Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Wendy
I think you look cute in your bunny costume.

Stan
What?

Wendy
I think you look cute in your bunny costume. What is that supposed to mean?!

Stan
...I have no idea.

Wendy
That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 

Stan
Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 

Man 1
Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?

Stan
Fine! 

Man 2
Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?

Stan
I don't know you!

Man 2
Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! 

Randy
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.

Stan
...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-

Randy
Stan, poke your grandma!

Stan
No. NO! Screw this! You know what? Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile. There! Delete Profile!  You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel Proceed!  Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No. Yes! Are you totally sure? Yes! 

Computer Voice
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh.

Stan
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 

Computer Voice
I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.

Delete Profile! Are you totally sure? Yes or- Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck?

Profile 4
Ignore.

Stan
Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!

Kyle
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.

Cartman
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.

Kyle
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.

Cartman
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.

Kyle
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.

Cartman
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?

Kyle
No. What's chatroulette?

Cartman
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.

Kyle
Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.

Cartman
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.

Kyle
Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 

Cartman
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?

Kyle
That's just a guy's penis too!

Cartman
Okay let's, let's try this one.

Kyle
Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!

Cartman
Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?

Dude
Hey.

Cartman
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.

Dude
Oh yeah? 

Cartman
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...

Kyle
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!

Cartman
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!

Stan
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?

Tom Davis
No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?

Stan
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.

Tom Davis
Ignore.  So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like

Stan
Okay I'll be your friend.

Tom Davis
Confirm.  Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?

Stan
Awww!

Guard
Play, profile!

Stan
Yahtzee. 

Cartman
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...

Kyle
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 

Cartman
Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.

Boy
Hello.

Cartman
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.

Boy
Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.

Kyle
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?

Boy
Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.

Kyle
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!

Kip's Dad
Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day.

Kip's Mom
No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now.

Referee
Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!

Stan
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!

Referee
That's not what your profile said.

Stan
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!

Referee
Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.

Stan
Oh yeah? I can try! 

Referee
After him!

Kyle
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. Hey Kyle, really like your farm. Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 

Stan
You're an asshole, Kyle!

Kyle
...What?

Stan
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!

Kyle
Dude, w-what are you doing?

Stan
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!

Kyle
Profile status?

Stan
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!

Kyle
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.

Stan
Dude! Fuck your crops! 

Kyle
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.

Stan
Where?

Kyle
Café World.

Stan
Son of a bitch! 

Kyle
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!

Isiah
Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.

Kyle
What? Why?

Isiah
User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.

Kyle
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.

Isiah
Ignore.

Kyle
Unh, that does it!

Stan
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 

Profile Stan Marsh
Right here.

Stan
Oh...

Kyle
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 

Stan
What do you want from me, dude?!

Profile Stan Marsh
I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.

Stan
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!

Profile Stan Marsh
Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.

Stan
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!

Profile Stan Marsh
Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. 

Referee
Let the final battle begin! 

Stan
Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? 

Profile Stan Marsh
What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-

No. Can't be.

Randy
Yahtzee!

Profile Stan Marsh
No! Ahhhhh. 

Stan
Awgh!  Oh thank God.

Randy
Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?

Stan
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.

Randy
Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?

Stan
Fuck off, Dad. 

Tour Guide
Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.

Cartman
Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!

Kyle
You should know, fatass.

Cartman
AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!

Stan
Oh God, you guys, really? This again? 

Tour Guide
And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.

Kyle
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.

Cartman
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.

Stan
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 

Butters
Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?

Stan
Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!

Tom Cruise
What did you call me?

Cartman
Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 

Butters
How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?

Tom Cruise
I'm not a fudge packer!

Kyle
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.

Tom Cruise
But I'm not a fudge packer! 

Stan
Then why are you packing fudge?

Tom Cruise
I'm not. I am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing! 

Stan
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.

Tom Cruise
Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!

Stan
For what?

Tom Cruise
You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it! 

Mr. Garrison
Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?

Tom Cruise
That's it!  I'm suing this entire intolerant town!

Stan
But dude-

Tom Cruise
No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!

Tom Cruise
Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to. 

Tiger Woods
That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!

Bono
I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!

Tom Cruise
Yeah, well I was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer!  I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in. 

Sally Struthers
South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country! 

George Lucas
That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!

Paris Hilton
If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me! 

Tom Cruise
Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.

All Celebrities
YEAH!

Jared Fogle
Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?

Tom Cruise
Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared.  No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more.  No that's a closet too.  Nope, Jared. That's a closet too.  No.  That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too.

Principal Victoria
Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!

Kyle
Dude, what did you do?

Stan
I have no idea...

Randy
You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!

Principal Victoria
Did you call him a fudge packer?

Stan
Aww... he was packing fudge!

Mayor
Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!

Mr. Mackey
They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!

Stan
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-

Principal Victoria
But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.

Gerald
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!

Sgt. Yates
Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!

Randy
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!

Randy
Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.

Tom Cruise
That's nice!  I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! 

Randy
Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 

Tom Cruise
WHAT?

Randy
We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...

Tom Cruise
I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! 

Randy
Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says Fred's Fudge and Candies... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 

Tom Cruise
Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.

Randy
ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.

Tom Cruise
It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-

Randy
Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.

Tom Cruise
Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.

Stan
Ooooooo...

Randy
That's... tricky...

Tom Cruise
Well then you can just get sued! 

Randy
Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-

Tom Cruise
No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!

Randy
Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.

Mr. Garrison
Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! 

Stephen
Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.

Kyle
Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.

Mr. Mackey
But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?

Sgt. Yates
Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. 

Stan
I saw him once. 

McDaniels
You did?

Stan
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.

Mr. Garrison
Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?

Stan
No, dude, it was totally fine.

Sgt. Yates
Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?

Stan
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...

Randy
Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 

Mr. Garrison
No, don't!  Is that okay to show?

Jimbo
I don't know. I guess we'll see.

Hillary Clinton
Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!

Jesse Jackson
Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.

Tom Cruise
No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?

Oprah Winfrey
You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?

Tom Cruise
Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power?  Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if no-one could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?

Jimmy Buffet
I... I'd love it!

Tom Cruise
By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule.  Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!

Tim Burton
Gee, that'd be swell.

Tom Cruise
Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him. 

Cartman
Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?

Tom Cruise
Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!

Cartman
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...

Michael Richards
Who? 

Jennifer Lopez
Alllloooo... 

Tom Cruise
Jennifer Lopez! 

Jennifer Lopez
Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.

Narrator
In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions; Jesus!  Buddha!  Krishna!  Muhammad!  Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith  and... the mighty Semen! 

Seaman
It's not semen, it's Seaman!

Narrator
Their mission; right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.

Stan
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.

Jesus
My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.

Buddha
We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people

Stan
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!

Narrator
Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...

Kyle
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?

Joseph Smith
No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.

Kyle
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?

Lao Tzu
No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.

Stan
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.

Jesus
But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.

Kyle
Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 

Joseph Smith
Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. 

Jesus
Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 

Kyle
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?

Joseph Smith
But he's talking from the U-Haul?

Stan
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!

Jesus
Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 

Moses
Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?

Kyle
There doesn't have to be...

Moses
Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.

Tom Cruise
Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.

Russel Crowe
Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? 

Rob Reiner
We take his goo! It's as simple as that friends. 

Tom Cruise
Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.

Rob Reiner
Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. 

Cartman
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?

Tom Cruise
No Jen, we all have got enough money.

Jennifer Lopez
Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!

Cartman
Uh, excuse us for a second... 

Cartman
Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?

Jennifer Lopez
What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!

Cartman
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!

Jennifer Lopez
Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!

Cartman
If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.

Mitch Conner
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.

Cartman
You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!

Mitch Conner
Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.

Cartman
Yeah, so what?

Mitch Conner
You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.

Cartman
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.

Mitch Conner
You catch on quick kid... 

Tom Cruise
Mrs. Lopez...

Mitch Conner
Hurry, get my wig back on! 

Tom Cruise
Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god  you found my fudge packing uniform...

Jennifer Lopez
Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!

Randy
Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.

Mayor
Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. 

Muhammad
You're welcome.

Mr Garrison
Oh, is that okay?

Jimbo
I don't know.

Randy
Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.

Stan
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.

Gerald
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.

Kyle
But Muhammad can't be seen dad.

Sgt. Yates
Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.

Stan
No, you can't even show his feet.

Sheila
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?

Mr. Garrison
No, you could still see his eyes...

Randy
Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 

Mayor
Muhammad, would that be OK?

Muhammad
OK.

Hillary Clinton
Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us! 

Tom Cruise
Rob, will the machine be ready?

Rob Reiner
Oh, it'll be ready! 

Jennifer Lopez
More tacos!

Jennifer Lopez
More tacos!

Cartman
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.

Jennifer Lopez
More tacos.

Cartman
You just had seven tacos.

Jennifer Lopez
I want more tacos! 

Cartman
I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?

Jennifer Lopez
I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!

Cartman
You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 

Charlie Sheen
Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?

Jennifer Lopez
Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?

Cartman
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!

Jennifer Lopez
Yes they do!

Cartman
I tried getting one last week!

Jennifer Lopez
Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.

Cartman
God, will somebody shut her up?

Randy
Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 

Mayor
You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 

Mr. Garrison
Hold on a second! 

Mr. Garrison
Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!

Mayor
What?!

Randy
Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 

Jared Fogle
Alright, we got him Tom. 

Stan
Muhammad, are you okay? 

Randy
What the hell was that?!

Sgt. Yates
Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.

Stan
They want his power?

Kyle
What kind of extremists are these? 

Sgt. Yates
You won't believe it...

Lead Ginger
Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!

All Gingers
Huzzah!

Mitch Conner
Where the hell do you think you're going?

Cartman
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 

Mitch Conner
You gonna walk away from 50 mil? 

Cartman
Let me by...

Mitch Conner
You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.

Cartman
Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.

Mitch Conner
Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. 

Cartman
My father...

Mitch Conner
Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?

Cartman
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.

Mitch Conner
You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. 

Cartman
How could you know anything about who my family is?

Mitch Conner
Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.

Cartman
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-

Mitch
You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...

Barbrady
Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.

Sgt. Yates
Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!

Mayor
Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!

Jimbo
We have to give in to their demands.

McDaniels
I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.

Kyle
We can't give him over to the gingers!

Stan
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.

Gerald
But our homes and our lives are at stake.

Stan
We made a promise... to Jesus! 

Randy
Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 

Jimbo
That'll be Tom Cruise... 

Randy
Helllo?

Tom Cruise
Yeah, so whats going on?

Randy
Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.

Tom Cruise
What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!

Randy
There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.

Tom Cruise
Gingers?

Kanye West
Gingers? Aww, hell no.

Randy
Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.

Tom Cruise
You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?

Randy
Well, yeah.

Tom Cruise
Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it! 

Tom Cruise
Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take  Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th- 

Rob Reiner
Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.

Hillary Clinton
Yeah, that would kill all our careers!

Tom Cruise
But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!

Rob Reiner
Fine, then let's have Her do it.

Tom Cruise
Her who?

Rob Reiner
You know... Her.

Tom Cruise
Oh right...  Her.

Rob Reiner
There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.

Robert Redford
My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.

Steven Spielberg
Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?

Tom Cruise
Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.

Rob Reiner
Power her up! Release the Kraken! 

Rob Reiner
Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner. 

Rob Reiner
Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help

Tom Cruise
We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand? 

Tom Cruise
Oh, she's pissed all right.

Mr. Garrison
Eric, what are you doing here?

Cartman
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?

Mr. Garrison
What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-

Cartman
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.

Mr. Garrison
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-

Cartman
I said GET. Mr. Hat!

Cartman
Put it on!  Do the voice.

Mr. Hat
Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. 

Mitch Conner
Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?

Mr. Hat
I... I don't believe I know you.

Mitch Conner
The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon. 

Mr. Garrison
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-

Cartman
Keep... your hand... UP!

Randy
Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 

Lead Ginger
Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...

Townspeople
Ohhhhhhh...

Stan
Dude, we can't do that

Lead Ginger
Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!

Mr. Hat
Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!

Mitch Conner
So you admit it. There was a cover up. 

Mr. Garrison
No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!

Mitch
Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!

Garrison
Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.

Cartman
By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?

Mitch Conner
Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could. 

Soldier 1
What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?

Mitch Conner
No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.

Soldier 2
Incoming! 

Army Doctor
Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.

Mitch Conner
And that's that. Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.

Mr. Garrison
Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.

Mitch Conner
Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.

Cartman
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!

Mr. Garrison
All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.

Randy
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.

Ginger 1
We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.

Stan
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!

Ginger 1
Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!

Jimbo
Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.

Ginger 1
Two!

Sgt. Yates
Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.

Ginger 1
Three!

Randy
Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 

Stan
Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.

Ginger 2
That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.

Santa
Sorry, boys. I tried.

Kyle
Aw crap.

Randy
Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?

Stan
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!

Mr. Hankey
I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.

Stan
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!

Ginger 1
So where is he?! 

Announcer
Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...

Jesus
Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.

Buddha
Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!

Jesus
Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!

Joseph Smith
Jesus Christ!

Jesus
What?

Joseph Smith
We've got a distress signal coming in. 

Jesus
On the Super Best Screen!

Police Officer
Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack! 

Jesus
Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! 

Lao Tse
I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.

Seaman
Yeah. Who would have activated her again?

Jesus
I don't know, Seaman. 

Seaman
It's Sea-Man! 

Police Officer
The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!

Jesus
Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 

Dr. Mephesto
There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy.  What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin.  We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful.  Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin.  Yes? What do you want?

Person
Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?

Dr. Mephesto
Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.

Person
Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!

Dr. Mephesto
There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.

Person
Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.

Dr. Mephesto
No, please, it isn't that at all.

Person
No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.

Dr. Mephesto
No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. 

Cartman
Ahaaa!

Dr. Mephesto
WAAH!

Kevin
AAAH!

Cartman
Nice work, Conner.

Mitch Conner
Yeah, the old Hasn't anything changed? speech. Works on white people all the time.

Dr. Mephesto
Eric Cartman?

Cartman
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!

Santa
Holy crap! 

Pip
Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 

Announcer
Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house.

Tom Cruise
How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!

Randy
Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!

Tom Cruise
We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!

Randy
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.

Tom Cruise
That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!

Mickey Mouse
Oh boy!

Stan
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!

Kenny
(I am. He's right here.) 

Stan
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.

Kyle
Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.

Stan
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.

Kyle
Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!

Kenny
(What?)

Kyle
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?

Stan
...Yeah.

Kyle
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 

Richard Tweek
She's going to get our coffee store next.

Mr. Slave
Ooooo, Jesus Christ. 

Jesus
That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 

Joseph Smith
No good!

Seaman
Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray! 

Dr. Mephesto
Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.

Cartman
Them who?!

Dr. Mephesto
Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.

Cartman
Then start explaining it to me!

Dr. Mephesto
Very well.

Kyle
Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.

Stan
Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!

Dr. Mephesto
Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! 

Kyle
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.

Dr. Mephesto
Oh, all right.

Cartman
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!

Stan
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!

Cartman
It's all that matters!

Kyle
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!

Cartman
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!

Announcer
In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer. 

Seaman
Our powers aren't working, Swallow. 

Joseph Smith
We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!

Jesus
We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!

Moses
What?

Jesus
We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!

Moses
Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.

Jesus
All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 

Seaman
It's Sea-Man and Swallow.

Jesus
Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!

Seaman
Fine! Swallow, come. 

Moses
Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.

Stan
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.

Dr. Mephesto
It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.

Kyle
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!

Mitch Conner
Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?

Kyle
Oh, you are not doing that again!

Mitch Conner
Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!

Kyle
Stop talking with your stupid hand!

Cartman
Who you calling stupid, Jew?

Stan
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 

Dr. Mephesto
Yes?

Man
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.

Dr. Mephesto
Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.

Man
...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.

Dr. Mephesto
Beat it I'm not helpin' you!

Kyle
Dude!

Stan
That's not cool!

Dr. Mephesto
No no, you don't understand.

Kyle
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!

Stan
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!

Dr. Mephesto
Alright, alright, jeez. 

Ginger 1
Hahaaa!

Stan
Oh crap, the gingers!

Cartman
Gingers? No!

Announcer
L-later, at the Legion of Doom.

Benedict XVI
Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!

Tom Cruise
What?! Impossible!

Benedict XVI
They are sending a message now!

Tom Cruise
On screen! 

Ginger 1
We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!

Rob Reiner
He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!

Ginger 1
Why do you think we're calling?!

Ginger 3
Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!

Tom Cruise
...Your ...boss?

Dr. Mephesto
What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.

Ginger 1
Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!

Stan
What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!

Ginger 2
Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.

Cartman
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?

Mitch Conner
You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.

Cartman
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?

Mitch Conner
You might wanna 

Cartman
Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 

A Voice
Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.

Cartman
Daddy?

A Voice
Guess again.  Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival.

Cartman
Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.

A Voice
Oh, but it can.  Revenge is a dish best served...  chili.

Cartman
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.

Announcer
Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...

Joseph Smith
That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working.

Jesus
Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.

Krishna
Form of... Neil Diamond.  If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand! 

Jesus
Let's hope to Christ this works. 

Krishna
Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times? 
Well that's because I love the girl. 
And I still love you now. What have you got to say? 
That might be true, but I still miss ya at night. 
When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight. 

Joseph Smith
It worked, Jesus!

Jesus
Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!

Scott Tenorman
Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha. 

Cartman
What do you know?!

Scott Tenorman
I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!

Announcer
Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...

Russell Crowe
Alright, Muhammad is secure. 

Tom Cruise
Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob.  Ohhh. Uhhh. Yes! I can feel it! I can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins!  Ha. Hahahaha! 

Paris Hilton
O M G it worked!

Tom Cruise
I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!

Benedict XVI
Ooo you lucky fucker.

Scott Tenorman
Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!

Liane
Please, leave my boy alone!

Cartman
Mom?

Scott Tenorman
I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!

Mr. Garrison
Please don't. We have to protect 'em.

Cartman
Protect who??

Scott Tenorman
Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  Jimbo! 

Jimbo
Protect... the Denver Broncos.

Announcer
Meanwhile...

Tom Cruise
This is incredible. Who wants to go next?

Benedict XVI
I want to be next.

Ginger 4
No, gingers go next.

Mickey Mouse
Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!

Rob Reiner
It's my goo machine! I'm next!

Jesus
Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!

Ginger 4
They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!

Jesus
Kyaaaaa!

Scott Tenorman
The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!

Mr. Garrison
They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!

Cartman
My dad was a Denver Bronco?

Scott Tenorman
Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?

Cartman
No- nooo.

Scott Tenorman
The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!

Liane
No please!

Scott Tenorman
Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!

Dr. Mephesto
It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.

Scott Tenorman
You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!

Cartman
No! Noooo!

Scott Tenorman
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili!  The Super Best Friends? Oh no! 

Seaman
I'll get you, Tom Cruise! 

Stan
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 

Tom Cruise
What did you say?!

Kyle
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.

Jesus
I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. 

Tom Cruise
Whoawhoa whoa whoa!  You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!

Scott Tenorman
I'll be back, Super Best Friends! 

Jesus
Who's the creepy ginger kid?

Tom Cruise
Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!

Kyle
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.

Jesus
That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.

Santa
That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.

Stan
Yeah.

Mayor McDaniels
Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.

Stan
Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...

Kyle
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.

Cartman
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?

Stan
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.

Cartman
My dad was a ginger!

Kyle
Wwait, what?

Cartman
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!

Kyle
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!

Mitch Conner
Hey Eric, Eric!

Cartman
What?

Mitch Conner
Come on, cheer up.

Cartman
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!

Mitch Conner
Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.

Cartman
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.

Kyle
You gotta be kidding me!

Mitch Conner
Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.

Cartman
Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?

Mitch Conner
There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.

Cartman
Take it easy, Conner. 

Stan
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.

Tom Cruise
I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.

Kyle
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.

Stan
We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!

Tom Cruise
You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh.  Oh please, can you show me where?

Stan
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.

Hey everybody, how's it goin'?

Towelie
I just... I just can't seem to stop.

Towelie
Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 

Towelie
Get out of my face! Get out of here! 

Towelie
My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 

Towelie
Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?

Stan
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!

Kyle
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.

Butters
Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!

Stan
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 

Singers
Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?

Jimmy
Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.

Timmy
Timmeh!

Jimmy
We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!

Frances
Hi Jimmy, hi Tim.

Timmy
Timmy.

Specialist 1
Wow, look at Lenora everyone.  Good job. Come on, good job Lenora. Ahahall right, good, let's get Lenora a towel.  Come on, come on, where's the towel?

Specialist 2
The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.

Specialist 3
Hey!  Where is that towel?!

Towelie
Oh yeah, just a sec. 

Stan
We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!

Specialist 3
What's going on, Towel?

Towelie
Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.

Specialist 3
We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!

Kyle
When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.

Towelie
I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 

Jimmy
Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.

Jimmy
All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?

Blue Team
Yeah!

Timmy
Timmy!

Blue Team
Yeah!  Alright!

Nathan
I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.

Mimsy
Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.

Nathan
Shut up, Mimsssyyy!

Mimsy
Doh, sorry, boss.

Nathan
Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?

Nathan
What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.

Mimsy
Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?

Nathan
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.

Specialist 1
There you go, Lenora, all better now?

Lenora
Yes, thanks.

Towelie
That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 

Lenora
Uhhh!

Specialist 3
Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off.

Towelie
You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!

Stan
A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.

Towelie
You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 

Butters
The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.

Towelie
Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!

Towelie
No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?

Specialist 1
All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!

Nathan
I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.

Mimsy
Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?

Nathan
Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.

Mimsy
Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh?  Oh! It's a snake.

Nathan
Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a black mamba.

Mimsy
Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? 

Specialist 4
You boys excited for the canoe race?

Nathan
Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.

Specialist 4
Canoes are fun, aren't day? 

Nathan
Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.

Specialist 1
All right, campers are we ready?

All
Yeah!

Nathan
Good luck, Jimmy.

Jimmy
You too, Ne-n-Nathan.

Nathan
You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole.

Specialist 1
Oh your mark, get set. 

Nathan
Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!

Mimsy
Darrr, you set to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.

Nathan
Not in our canoe, Mimsy!

Steve
Heeey. Hey, we need a towel! 

Towelie
Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!

Steve
Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  What's going on?! 

Towelie
Hey, you own me money, asshole!

Specialist 1
That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!

Kyle
Please, sir.

Specialist 1
We need a nice, clean towel here at summer camp. We don't need a towel that shoots heroin and has sex for money!

Towelie
Heh, some people are so picky about their towels

Specialist 3
All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first. 

Nathan
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.

Mimsy
Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh buss?

Nathan
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map

Mimsy
Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?

Nathan
No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.

Mimsy
Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? 

Counselor Steve
Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?

Nathan
Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!

Mimsy
I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. 

Mimsy
Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?

Nathan
Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.

Mimsy
Dahhhoh boy!

Nathan
This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. Turn left at the... Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!

Mimsy
Why sure it is, boss.

Nathan
I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!

Mimsy
No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. 

Nathan
Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!

Towelie
Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 

Cashier
You must have one dusty computer.

Towelie
Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.

Towelie
It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.

Butters
I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!

Towelie
Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!

Butters
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!

Towelie
Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 

Specialist 1
All right! In the surfing competition, the Red Team is up three points to two.  And now it's Jimmy Valmer's turn. 

Timmy
Timmeh!

Frances
Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy. 

Nathan
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.

Mimsy
Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?

Nathan
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.

Mimsy
Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'

Nathan
No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.

Mimsy
Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. 

Steve
Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?

Nathan
Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm. 

Mimsy
Gee that was a close one, huh boss? They almost had me saying we were gonna kill Jimmy.

Nathan
Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.

Mimsy
Dohh boy! 

Timmy
Timmih.

Jimmy
Gonna catch a wave... 

Mimsy
Dahhh I got me a shark whistle.

Jimmy
Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 

Mimsy
Dohoho, oh boy!

Nathan
Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.

Mimsy
Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. 

Nathan
You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...

Nathan
Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee!

Stan
Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.

Butters
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.

Towelie
Wha' what's goin' on?

Jeff VanVonderen
You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends? 

Towelie
What is everybody doing here?

Jeff VanVonderen
We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?

Butters
Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.

Towelie
Aw Jesus, man.

Jeff VanVonderen
Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish.

Butters
You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?

Towelie
I I don't, I don't get this.

Jeff VanVonderen
Kyle?

Kyle
Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.

Towelie
Could we just end this please?

Jeff VanVonderen
You have to let him finish, Towelie.

Kyle
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.

Jeff VanVonderen
Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?

Cartman
Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.

Kyle
We're here for Towelie, fatass!

Cartman
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 

Kyle
This is serious, you fucking asshole!

Cartman
I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!

Jeff VanVonderen
Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.

Kyle
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-

Jeff VanVonderen
Kyle please, It is not your turn!

Cartman
You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?

Kyle
Oh my God!

Jimmy
It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula danceI fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.So I made up my mind-

Nathan
Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.

Jimmy
So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.

Campers
Wawawawander...

Jimmy
Hurr a little Tardicaca...

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
She's a candy cane to wiggle

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
She's sure to make you g-giggle.

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '

Mimsy
Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.

Nathan
Shut up, Mimsssyyy!

Cartman
If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 

Jeff VanVonderen
Okay, Stan, you want to go next?

Stan
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?

Towel
What treatment?! What are you all talkin' about?!

Jeff VanVonderen
If you say yes, we leave here, pack your things, get on a plane, go to a treatment facility in Southern California, it's all set up.

Towelie
No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.

Jeff VanVonderen
Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore.

Towelie
Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 

Butters
Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!

Towelie
Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.

Jimmy
Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-

Nathan
Dammit dammit!

Nathan
Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.

Mimsy
Dahh okay boss. 

Jimmy
If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-

Mimsy
Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!

Jimmy
Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.

Mimsy
Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?

Nathan
Yeeeah!

Jimmy
Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. 

Mimsy
Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. 

Nathan
Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?

Mimsy
D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.

Nathan
That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!

Nathan
Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!

Towelie
Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.

Butters
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 

Jeff VanVonderen
You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie. 

Towelie
All right. All right, I'll go.

Butters
You will?

Towelie
I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.

Jeff VanVonderen
He's goin', everybody. Hugs! 

Jimmy
Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.

Nathan
I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.

Mimsy
Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.

Nathan
Shut up... Mimsssyyy. 

Counselor
Hi, Towelie?

Towelie
Yeah, hi.

Counselor
Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff.

Towelie
I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.

Singer
Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over

Stan
Cartman, dude, what's wrong?

Cartman
Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?

Kyle
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.

Cartman
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.

Kyle
What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up?

Cartman
I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 

Stan
Why not?

Cartman
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!

Stan
Cartman, tell us.

Cartman
No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 

Stan
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.

Cartman
Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 

Kyle
Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.

Cartman
No I can't; I'll always be like this. 

Stan
Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.

Cartman
Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 

Kyle
What?!

Cartman
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!

Stan
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!

Cartman
Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!

Kenny
(What?)

Cartman
You love NASCAR huh?

Kenny
(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)

Cartman
You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 

Kyle
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!

Cartman
I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 

Stan
Dude, you are so retarded!

Cartman
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.

Kyle
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!

Cartman
You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 

Kyle
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!

Cartman
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 

Cartman
Butters.

Butters
Hey Eric.

Cartman
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!

Butters
Ahhh well oh- kay.

Cartman
But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??

Butters
Eeyeah, I'm psyched.

Cartman
Get really psyched up, Butters!

Butters
I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.

Cartman
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!

Butters
NASCA- NASCAR?

Cartman
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.

Butters
You're givin' away all your money??

Cartman
Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.

Butters
You sure you want to do this?

Cartman
I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.

Spokesman
Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR.

Kenny
(Yeah! How cool!)

Spokesman
How who's ready for Saturday's big race? 

Kenny
(Woohoo!)

Spokesman
We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America! 

Kenny
(Woohoo!)

Spokesman
I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport. 

Kenny
(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)

Butters
Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 

Man 1
Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.

Butters
Hey Eric.

Cartman
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?

Butters
Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?

Cartman
I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.

Charlie
Hey- hey, there's a hot girl over there. 

Jake
Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. 

Butters
Feel stupid yet?

Cartman
Not yet.

Woman 1
When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-

Cartman
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!

Woman 1
To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.

Cartman
Fucking gross!

Butters
All those ladies have stinky vaginas?

Woman 1
If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.

Woman 2
For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.

Cartman
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!

Cartman
Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.

Butters
Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.

Cartman
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.

Butters
Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?

Cartman
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?

Butters
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.

Cartman
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?

Butters
No, you're good. 

Cartman
Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 

Woman 3
Little boy, what are you doing? 

Cartman
Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!

Butters
Really?

Cartman
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.

Butters
That was fast.

Cartman
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!

Announcer
We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. 

Butters
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.

Dale
What?

Butters
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.

Dale
Oh my God! 

Cartman
Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 

Butters
Eric, are you sure you can do this?

Cartman
Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.

Announcer
Let the race begin!

Cartman
Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.

Butters
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.

Cartman
What's that?

Butters
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.

Cartman
Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 

Announcer
It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!

Cartman
Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 

Cartman
Oh, fuck my ass! 

Butters
Eric?

Cartman
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.

Butters
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.

Cartman
Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.

Butters
Eric! Don't ever talk like that!

Cartman
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.

Doctor
Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.

Butters
How bad is it, doctor?

Doctor
He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a lever 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.

Butters
Well at least there's that.

Cartman
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.

Doctor
You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.

Cartman
Aw donkey balls...

Doctor
You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! 

Cartman
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.

Doctor
No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! 

Butters
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.

Cartman
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?

Butters
It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?

Cartman
Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 

FOX 11 Anchor
You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid?  Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people.

Reporter
Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this  Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom.

Kenny
(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)

Reporter
The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.

Kenny
(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)

Cartman
Oh hey, Kenny.

Kenny
(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)

Cartman
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 

Kenny
(Dude, fuck you!)

Cartman
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.

Kenny
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)

Cartman
Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!

Kenny
(No you fucking don't!)

Cartman
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!

Kenny
(What?!)

Cartman
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.

Man
Uh, excuse me.  Eric Cartman?

Cartman
Yeah?

Man
My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.

Cartman
...Uh oh.

Geoff Hamill
Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. 

Cartman
Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!

Geoff Hamill
Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.

Cartman
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!

Kenny
(No fucking way!)

Geoff Hamill
And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.

Cartman
Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 

Announcer
We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.

Reporter 1
So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns? 

Jimmie Johnson
Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-

Cartman
Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.

Reporter 2
Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake plate problems?

Jeff Gordon
Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-

Cartman
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.

Dale Earnhardt, Jr.
Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?

Cartman
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!

Danica Patrick
Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?

Cartman
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!

Butters
You seemed really stupid, Eric.

Cartman
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.

Tony Kornheiser
Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.

Cartman
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this Obama wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.

Butters
Obama's fuckin' gay.

Cartman
He's fuckin' gay as hell!

Butters
Pissin' me off!

Cartman
So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!

Tony Kornheiser
Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor...  and the stupid.

Kenny
(Fuck this!) 

Commentator 1
The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.

Commentator 2
Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.

Geoff
Thank you, Chris.

Chris
Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?

Geoff
Vagisil is very excited to be a part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.

Commentator 1
Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?

Announcer
Gentlemen, start your engines! 

Cartman
Alright, start your engine. What's that mean?

Pit Crewman
That means you flip the switch that says Engine.  Is he stupid or what?

Butters
Yeah, he's a champion alright.

Security Guard
Check your bag please, sir?  No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track.

Kenny
(Aww, come on!)

Security Guard
Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!

Kenny
(Aw come on, fuck you!) 

Security Guard
You might be able to buy one in the gift shop. 

Announcer
The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.

Cartman
Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!

Pit Crewman
This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!

Cartman
Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 

Danica Patrick
The fuck are you doing?!

Cartman
Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 

Danica Patrick
Oh, son of a bitch!

Cartman
Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!

Commentator 1
And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.

Chris
Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?

Geoff Hamill
Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  Every. Day.  Every. Day.  And available nationwide.

Butters
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.

Cartman
Oh yeah, I see it. 

Danica Patrick
AAAAAA! 

Cartman
You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!

Butters
That's fuckin' gay as hell.

Cartman
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!

Butters
There you go. You're back on the track.

Cartman
I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!

Kenny
(Stop this car!)

Cartman
Get off my car, Kenny!

Kenny
(Stop this car right now!)

Butters
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 

Cartman
We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!

Kenny
(I fucking hate you!)

Cartman
Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 

Kenny
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) 

Driver
Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 

Chris
Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.

Geoff Hamill
This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently.  Very. Diligently.  Patty? Patty?

Announcer
It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car. 

Geoff Hamill
What? 

Lowes Pit Boss
Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.

Geoff Hamill
Let me talk to her.  Patty? Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? 

Cartman
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.

Butters
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.

Cartman
Fuckin' gay as hell. 

Geoff Hamill
Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.

Announcer
They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. 

Cartman
Oh, fuck my ass again! 

Geoff Hamill
HAAAAAAAAAA!

Announcer
Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.

Geoff Hamill
Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!

Kenny
(HA! You fucking lose!)

Cartman
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.

Butters
Huh?

Cartman
The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!

Butters
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 

Cartman
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!

Butters
But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.

Kyle
Mom, Dad, what's muff cabbage? 

Gerald
Muff cabbage?

Sheila
Where did you hear that?

Ike
Muff cabbage!

Kyle
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop muff cabbage.

Ike
Muff cabbage.

Sheila
A new family moved in? Where are they from?

Kyle
She said they're from New Jersey.

Sheila
New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?

Kyle
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.

Sheila
Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?

Kyle
Know what, Ma?

Ike
Muff cabbage!

Sheila
Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.

Teresa
And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!

Teresa
Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.

Teresa
Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?

Sharon
Oh, Linda, huh?

Teresa
Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage!  I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you have a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!

Joe
So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?

Randy
I don't really work out.

Joe
Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat.

Teresa
Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?

Sharon
Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.

Teresa
Ears out to here!  So I tell her, You got big ears, sweetie. I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.

Sharon
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 

Teresa
That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.

Teresa
You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution...  ...whore! You probably sell your muff...  ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you!  You're nothin' but garbage!  That's what you are! You're garbage!  You sick, old woman! Muff garbage!  Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!

Sharon
Wow.

Teresa
Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! Okay, I love you.

Joe
Take it easy.

Teresa
I love you.  I love you.

Teresa
I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.

Teresa
Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Me!

Stan
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!

Cartman
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.

Kyle
Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?

Cartman
Oops, busted. 

Stan
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing.

Jersey Man
Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.

Cartman
Aw, crap, there's more of them?

Jersey Man
'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? 

Steve Last Call
So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, Who's from Jersey?, and people are all like, Yo! Woo-hoo! Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. 

Woman
Yeah, let's get this party started. 

Kyle
Where the hell are they coming from?! 

Teresa
Danielle was being a stupid bitch.

Woman 1
Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!

Teresa
I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage!  Oh, Sharon!  Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.

Jacqueline
And Sicilian.

Teresa
That's Danielle. She's from Jersey.  And that's Caroline.

Caroline
I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.

Salon Girl
I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? 

Jacqueline
When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.

Teresa
Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!

Caroline
Teresa! Calm down.

Salon Girl
I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!

Teresa
Get her, Sharon!

Sharon
What?

Jacqueline
Sharon, just stay out of it!

Caroline
Be the bigger person, Sharon!

Sharon
You people are crazy.

Caroline
Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?!  Is my family crazy?!

Teresa
Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! 

Sheila
Let go of her, you piece of trash! 

Teresa
Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?!

Sheila
All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!

Teresa
Psycho bitch!

Sheila
No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 

Jacqueline
You're cabbage! 

Sharon
Sheila?

Randy
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 

Mr. Garrison
Jesus! Why are they doing this?

Randy
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.

Jimbo
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!

All
Yeah!

Sheila
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.

Jimbo
How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? 

Sheila
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.

Sharon
Sheila, who are you talking to?

Sheila
You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. 

Cartman
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!

Kyle
Hey, dudes.

Cartman
Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.

Kyle
What are you talking about?

Cartman
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!

Kyle
So what?

Cartman
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!

Kyle
No, it doesn't!

Cartman
He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.

Kyle
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.

Cartman
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!

Kyle
What's strike three?!

Cartman
You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!

Kyle
Shut the fuck up!  What?

Stan
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?

Kyle
Why does it matter?!

Stan
No, uh, it just explains a lot.

Cartman
Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!

Kyle
No, it isn't!

Cartman
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.

Stan
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.

Kenny
(Yeah.)

Cartman
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!

Kyle
No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.

Sheila
Kyle? You in there?

Kyle
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 

Sheila
Kyle, open the door.

Kyle
Not now, Mom. Please.

Sheila
Kyle, this instant! One, two. 

Kyle
All right, all right. 

Sheila
I guess we need to talk.

Sheila
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.

Kyle
What am I, Mom?

Sheila
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.

Kyle
What are you saying?!

Sheila
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.

Kyle
No! I don't wanna look like this!

Sheila
It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.

Ike
Aaaahhhhh! 

Kyle
I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!

Announcer
Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the Jersey News with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!

P-Train
What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.

Reporter
People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out.  And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops!  It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!

Tan Jovi
What's up with that?!

P-Train
What's up with that?!

Tan Jovi
Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!

Randy
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.

Schwarzenegger
We are very sorry, but California cannot afford helping you at this time.

Randy
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?

Schwarzenegger
No, because Utah is between Colorado and California.

Randy
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!

Schwarzenegger
Nevada.

Randy
Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!

Cartman
What the hell are you guys doing?!

Stan
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.

Cartman
And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!

Kyle
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!

Cartman
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!

Kyle
That's enough!

Cartman
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!

Kyle
Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 

Cartman
That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!

Randy
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!

Stuart
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.

Randy
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.

Mr. Garrison
What are you talking about?

Randy
We could ask Al Qaeda.

Stephen
Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!

Randy
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.

Stephen
And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!

Bar Patron 1
Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bad quick! There's trouble!

Randy
People from Jersey?

Bar Patron 1
I don't know what the hell I saw.

Skeeter
It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.

Barbrady
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 

Bar Patron 2
It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! 

Randy
What is it?

Bar Patron 2
It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. 

Randy
That thing is famous? Why?

Bar Patron 2
I don't know!

Jimbo
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 

Snooki
Snooki.

Randy
Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 

Stephen
Aaagh! Get it off of me!

Snooki
Snooki smoosh.

Stephen
Shoot it! 

Cartman
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, I'll smash your teeth in! My head is all like gashed open.

Butters
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.

Cartman
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!

Butters
Are you being serious?

Cartman
This is very serious, Butters.

Butters
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.

Cartman
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.

Operative
Istagia makuman? 

Randy
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 

Snooki
Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.

Cartman
Come on, you guys, hurry!

Stan
Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?

Cartman
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!

Kenny
(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 

Cartman
Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.

Kyle
Why?

Cartman
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!

Kyle
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.

Cartman
Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.

Kyle
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!

Cartman
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 

Stan
Dude, what are you doing?

Cartman
Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.

Kyle
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?

Cartman
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!

Kyle
No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?

Cartman
You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!

Snooki
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.

Cartman
Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?

Stephen
Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?

Mr. Garrison
He's still questioning that new prisoner.

Randy
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!

The Situation
Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. 

Randy
What does that mean?!

The Situation
You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. 

Randy
Stop playing stupid!

Jimbo
Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.

Randy
Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!

The Situation
It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. 

Gerald
Here they come! 

Sharon
Is it them, Randy?

Randy
Yup. They're from Jersey alright.

Jersey People
Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!

Jersey Man 2
Let's go creepin' in this town!

Jersey Woman
Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!

Randy
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 

Randy
Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!

DogPoo
Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

Snooki
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.

Stan
Try to find a way past it!

Cartman
What does it want?!

Butters
Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.

Snooki
Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.

Cartman
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!

Stan
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?

Kyle
Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!

Stan
Why? 

Kyle
Agggh! Agggh!  No! 

Stan
Dude.

Kyle
Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!

Snooki
Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth...

Kyle
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 

Cartman
Thank you, Kyle.

Jimbo
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!

Randy
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!

Stuart
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 

Jimbo
Who is that?! 

Randy
It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 

Randy
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, Go away! Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 

Stan
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.

Kyle
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.

Cartman
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.

Stan
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling Muff cabbage, what's muff cabbage?

Kyle
It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.

Randy
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 

Paratrooper
Tango is down, tango is down.

Randy
We got him!

Cartman
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 

Butters
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.

Stan
A note?

Butters
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 

Kyle
What's it say?

Stan
We need to talk.

Cartman
Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says We need to talk you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.

Red
Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?

Wendy
Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called hoarding. People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.

Stan
Is something wrong, Wendy? 

Wendy
Stan? We need to talk about your locker.

Stan
My locker?

Wendy
Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.

Stan
Are you serious?

Wendy
It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.

Stan
Well it's just a little messy.

Wendy
No, Stan, it's called hoarding! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!

Stan
Aw come on.

Wendy
Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?

Stan
Yeah, alright.

Wendy
Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.

An Expert
Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. 

Stan
What, come on, it's not that bad.

Dr. Chinstrap
Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.

Stan
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.

Dr. Chinstrap
Okay, great. How about we start with this? 

Stan
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.

Dr. Chinstrap
Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this?  Broken toothbrush.

Stan
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-

Dr. Chinstrap
But it's broken.

Stan
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-

Dr. Chinstrap
Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box.  Now how about this?  Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.

Class
Eeeeewwww! 

Stan
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.

Dr. Chinstrap
It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?

Stan
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-

Dr. Chinstrap
The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?

Stan
Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 

Dr. Chinstrap
Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?

Stan
Well no, don't throw that out.

Dr. Chinstrap
Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? 

Stan
No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 

Kyle
Dude. What's wrong with you?

Stan
I don't... I don't know.

Kyle
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.

Mr. Mackey
Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? 

Stan
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... hoarding.

Mr. Mackey
Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?

Stan
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?

Mr. Mackey
Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?

Stan
Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?

Mr. Mackey
Me? ...Like, like what?

Stan
Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-

Mr. Mackey
DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!

Dr. Chinstrap
There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.

Principal Victoria
But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?

Sharon
Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.

Dr. Chinstrap
We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.

Sharon
Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.

Dr. Chinstrap
I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.

Randy
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.

Dr. Chinstrap
Oh no, really?

Sgt. Yates
Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.

Mr. Yelman
...Well I, that is I, I-

Dr. Chinstrap
It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. 

Partner
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.

Dr. Chinstrap
Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.

Mr. Yelman
Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.

Dr. Chinstrap
It's pronounced hoarder, and yes you are.

Mr. Yelman
But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.

Dr. Chinstrap
Yes, you are herding sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.

Mr. Yelman
No, but I just thought that-

Dr. Chinstrap
Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.

Mr. Mackey
M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?

Dr. Chinstrap
Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... Light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. Float-  WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!

Mr. Mackey
What?! What?! Jesus, what?!

Mr. Yelman
Oh my God!

Dr. Chinstrap
Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second.  Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... Now the cloud is near you. You... you reach out to it.

Mr. Mackey
Okay...

Dr. Chinstrap
It's the cloud of your memories, of your past.  Your childhood perhaps. What do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?

Mr. Mackey
Billy. Billy Thompson?

Billy
There he is! Hey, Mackey! 

Mackey
Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?

Billy
Come 'ere! 

Mackey
Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...

Billy
You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.

Mackey
Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay?  Huhhhhh!

Billy
You're gonna die Mackey!  Hold his legs!  Come back here!

Mackey
Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. 

Stan
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?

Mackey
Shh. Be quiet.

Mr. Yelman
'Scuse me, where are we?

Mackey
Shh. You've goota be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.

Stan
What the hell's going on?!

Dr. Chinstrap
What the hell is going on?!

Partner
The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.

Dr. Chinstrap
Oh Jesus.

Randy
What does that mean?

Dr. Chinstrap
It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.

Randy
What?!

Partner
I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.

Randy
Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?

Dr. Chinstrap
It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.

Pinkerton
Alright.  Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams.  Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. 

Mackey
Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?

Stan
Mr. Mackey.

Mackey
Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.

Stan
Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?

Mackey
Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.

Stan
Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!

Mackey
Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll!  I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this.  Okay now crank it back, and now I let go.  Okay. Okay.

Stan
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.

Mackey
Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!

Mr. Yelman
Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.

Stan
I'm working on it!

Mackey
Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!

Stan
Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 

Billy
You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is a field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!

Mackey
No, uh Billy, please, ukay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.

Billy
See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! 

Mackey
Oh Jesus...

Stan
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?

Mackey
Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. 

Stan
Ohhhhhhh.

Mr. Mackey
Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.

Randy
What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!

Dr. Chinstrap
Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.

Randy
That does it! 

Dr. Chinstrap
What are you doing?!

Randy
I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!

Dr. Chinstrap
Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!

Randy
Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!

Dr. Chinstrap
It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!

Randy
I said get me in there!

Dr. Chinstrap
Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.

Randy
Ahhh.

Bus Driver
Alright kids, everyone on the bus.

Stan
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?

Mackey
It's the day of the big field trip.

Billy
Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.

Mackey
Oh Jesus.

Stan
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!

Bus Driver
Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!

Mr. Yelman
Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.

Driver
It's pronounced hoarder, young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 

Mr. Yelman
Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.

Stan
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.

Randy
Stan?  Stan!

Stan
Dad? Is that you?

Randy
Yes, it's me, Stan.

Stan
Where are you?

Randy
It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!

Stan
The hell are you doing, dad?

Randy
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!

Stan
Did you come here to help me?

Randy
I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!

Stan
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!

Randy
Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.

Stan
DAD!

Randy
Aah ahhh aha ahhh.

Stan
Aaaaaagh!

Pinkerton
Uh oh, something's wrong.

Dr. Chinstrap
What is it?!

Pinkerton
The father. He's gone completely off chart.

Sharon
Off chart? What does that mean?

Pinkerton
We don't even know.

Dr. Chinstrap
I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.

Sharon
Who are the experts? 

Leonardo DiCaprio
Get that door closed! Keep me covered! 

Dr. Chinstrap
Ah good, you're here.

DiCaprio
What's the sitch?!

Dr. Chinstrap
Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.

Expert 1
We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!

Sharon
What next dream level?

DiCaprio
Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream.  We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.

Sharon
Why?

Expert 1
Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.

Sharon
What's that?

Expert 2
Empty scary dreamspace.

Sharon
So like a nightmare?

Expert 3
No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!

Sharon
Why can't you wake up from that?

Expert 1
You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!

Sharon
That doesn't sound very difficult.

Expert 1
It is!

Sharon
Why?

Expert 4
Arrgh.

Expert 1
We don't have time for this!

Sharon
Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?

Expert 1
Then we go into your husband's dream!

Sharon
Okaaay...

DiCaprio
But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.

Sharon
Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?

Hasselback
I am.

Sharon
Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?

DiCaprio
Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!

Sharon
Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?

DiCaprio
Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.

Expert 1
It's so complex and cool.

Sharon
Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!

DiCaprio
You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! 

Sharon
Will they be able to wake Mackey up?

Dr. Chinstrap
If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.

Sharon
Why?

Dr. Chinstrap
Because.

Ranger Pete
Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.

Class
Hi Ranger Pete.

Mackey
Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.

Ranger Pete
Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.

Mackey
Oh that should be fun, m'kay.  Ahhhh...

Ranger Pete
But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. 

Mackey
Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!

Stan
Who's that?

Mackey
Give a hoot, don't pollute, m'kay.

Woodsy Owl
Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,

Mackey
Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay.  Oh, boy I love that song.

Ranger Pete
Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.

Billy
We wanna be in Mackey's group!

Mackey
Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.

Ranger Pete
That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.

Mackey
Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? 

DiCaprio
Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?

Expert 2
I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!

DiCaprio
Oh well. Just keep shooting!

Stan
What the fuck?

An Expert
Mommy? Mommy?

Fire Captain
So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?

Dr. Chinstrap
Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.

Fireman 1
Well, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?

Pinkerton
It's very simple: You see,  when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.

Fireman 1
Like a taco within a taco?

Fire Captain
A double-decker taco supreme.

Pinkerton
Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.

Fire Captain
Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? 

Pinkerton
Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.

Pizza Man
Somebody order a pizza?

Pinkerton
No.

Dr. Chinstrap
Probably one of them in the dream.

Pizza Man
Alright, I'm goin' in. 

Pinkerton
Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.

Dr. Chinstrap
And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! 

Mackey
Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!

Stan
Mr. Mackey, stop running!

Mackey
But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay!  They're gonna kick it bad!

Stan
Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.

Mackey
I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.

Billy
There he is! You can't run forever!

Mackey
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... 

Stan
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.

Mr. Yelman
But I literally herd sheep.

Stan
Shut up!

Mackey
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?

Pizza Man
Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?

Pinkerton
Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.

Dr. Chinstrap
Alright, that does it.  Get your coat.

Pinkerton
Where are we going?

Dr. Chinstrap
We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.

Pinkerton
You don't mean...

Dr. Chinstrap
Hello, Freddy.  You're looking healthy.

Freddy Krueger
Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?

Dr. Chinstrap
Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.

Freddy Krueger
Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. 

Dr. Chinstrap
There's some good men stuck in there.

Freddy Krueger
I said I'm done with it! 

Woman
Everything all right, Fred?

Freddy Krueger
It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. 

Dr. Chinstrap
Wife and kids.

Freddy Krueger
No thanks to you.

Dr. Chinstrap
We need ya Fred.

Freddy Krueger
Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!

Dr. Chinstrap
We had a country to protect!

Freddy Krueger
Protect it yourselves this time.

Dr. Chinstrap
Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!

Freddy Krueger
Then you should have no problem covering it up. 

Dr. Chinstrap
Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.

Freddy Krueger
Alright, fine.

Mackey
Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!

Billy
You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! 

Stan
You can do it Mr. Mackey.

Mackey
Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?

Billy
Alright Mackey. Take this. 

DiCaprio
Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!

Stan
What the hell?

Expert 2
We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.

Fire Captain
Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.

Stan
Who are you people?

DiCaprio
We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.

Stan
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?

Expert 1
No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.

Expert 2
Right. 

Stan
...Well then why aren't we waking up?

Expert 2
Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.

Mackey
Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.

Expert 2
Oh, whoops.

Mackey
I remember.  I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. 

Real Mackey
No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?

Mackey
Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! 

Fire Captain
What's happening?

Expert 2
Dream conundrum. This is bad. 

Fire Captain
What the hell's going on?

DiCaprio
The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed!  Our dream bullets don't hurt it. 

Mackey
No! No more, Woodsy. 

Stan
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!

Expert 1
He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! 

Freddy Krueger
There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! 

Mackey
It's dead... It's finally dead. 

Dr. Chinstrap
Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.

Pinkerton
They're waking up. They're coming to. 

Dr. Chinstrap
Ahhh, you're back, everyone! 

Randy
Aw, dammit. 

Fire Captain
Thanks, Freddy.

Freddy Krueger
If only I could have saved the sheep herder.

Dr. Chinstrap
Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problem, Mr. Mackey?

Mr. Mackey
I sure did.

DiCaprio
Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.

Mr. Mackey
I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?

Fire Captain
So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying Give a hoot, don't pollute and touching his penis with his wing?

Pinkerton
Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!

Dr. Chinstrap
Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?

Stan
I think I have a better idea.

Wendy
Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?

Stan
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.

Kyle
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.

Stan
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!

Kyle
How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 

Coon
My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening.  I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it.  Yes, Toolshed.

Toolshed
Why do we have to be called Coon and Friends?

Coon
...What?

Toolshed
We all fight crime together. How come we're just your friends?

TupperWear
Yeah. We wanna be called The Extreme Avenger League.

All
Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!

Coon
I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.

TupperWear
Why not?

Coon
It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.

Mosquito
Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?

Coon
Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!

Mosquito
Have, so.

Coon
Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city.  Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.

Iron Maiden
Timmeh!

Coon
Let's work, people!  Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber?  Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean?  I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity.  Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.

Mint-Berry Crunch
Like milk?

Coon
No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- 

Alarm
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.

Coon
Uh oh!  What's the alert, Mosquito?

Mosquito
There's like a big fire or something in town.

Coon
What? A fire? Coon volume up! 

News 4 Reporter
There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.

Coon
My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!

Coon's Friends
Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! 

Coon
Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. 

Coon
We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!

Liane
Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?

Coon
Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!

Liane
Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 

Coon
Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! 

Liane
All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?

Coon
Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!

Liane
Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!

Coon
Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please?  Unbelievable! 

Fireman
We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!

Fire Captain
Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!

Liane
Oh my goodness, it's a fire. 

Coon
Come on, Coon Friends!

Liane
No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!

Fire Captain
Can we try a helicopter?

Fireman
The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. 

Coon
All right, what seems to be the problem?

Fire Captain
Get back, kids. It isn't safe.

Liane
Eric, poopsie?

Coon
Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!

Mosquito
And friends!

Fire Captain
Keep those children back, Thompson! 

Coon
Please sir, you must let us-

Liane
Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.

Coon
Shut! Up! Mom! God!

Officer
Wait. Look! Up in the sky!

Fireman
It's him! My God, it's really him!

Fire Captain
He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! 

Stan
Who's Captain Hindsight?

Announcer
Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age.  Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! 

Fire Captain
Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!

Captain Hindsight
What's the skinny?

Fireman
There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.

Captain Hindsight
Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.

Fireman
Yes, of course.

Captain Hindsight
And then you see that building to the left?

Fire Captain
Yes.

Captain Hindsight
They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! 

Fireman
Thank you, Captain Hindsight!

Officer
Thank youuu!

Fire Captain
All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. 

Randy
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?

Sharon
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.

Randy
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!

Sharon
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.

Randy
I mean, hello!

Stan
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.

Randy
Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 

Alarm
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. 

Randy
What the hell is that?  Who put that there?

Alarm: Alert.
Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.

Stan
Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?

Sharon
Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?

Randy
I don't know.

Sharon
Well take it down. It's noisy.

Randy
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 

Coon
Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.

Toolshed
Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?

Mosquito
Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.

Coon
The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.

TupperWear
So what's the huge catastrophe?

Coon
What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!

The Human Kite
Yeah, so?

Coon
So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!

Toolshed
Oh Jesus...

Coon
I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!

Professor Chaos
Hey fellas?  Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. 

Coon
You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!

Professor Chaos
Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now.  And I ain't got nothin' to eat.

Coon
You've got poop, don'tcha?  Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?

Mysterion
Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?

Coon
I CARE!

Mysterion
Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.

Coon
There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!

BP Man 1
All right, this looks like a jolly good place.

BP Man 2
Yes. Let's let her rip. 

BP Man 3
That's it, lads. Collect that oil! 

BP Man 4
Uh oh!  Oh deah.

BP Man 3
Oh, don't tell me we did it again?

Alarm
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.  All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. 

Coon
Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! 

Reporter
It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.

Man
It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.

Woman
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?

Cajun Shrimper
Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!

Mysterion
My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!

The Human Kite
We've got to help those people!

Coon
Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.

Mint-Berry Crunch
Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! 

Rescuer 1
Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! 

Coon
Oh no!

Captain Hindsight
What seems to be the problem?

Rescuer 2
It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.

Rescuer 3
If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.

Captain Hindsight
Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?

Rescuer 3
Yes.

Captain Hindsight
It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!

Rescuer 2
Aha!

Rescuer 4
Yesss, YESSS.

Captain Hindsight
Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.

Rescuer 2
I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.

Captain Hindsight
Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!

Rescuer 5
My God, he's right!

Captain Hindsight
My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!

Rescuer 4
God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!

Coon
Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!

Butler
Can I help you?

Cartman
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?

Butler
Yes?

Cartman
I need to speak with him, please.

Butler
The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.

Cartman
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.

Butler
Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.

Captain Hindsight
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?

Cartman
Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.

Captain Hindsight
Of what?

Cartman
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.

Officer 2
Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! 

Captain Hindsight
Go ahead.

Officer 2
The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!

Captain Hindsight
Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.

Officer 2
Right.  Thank you! 

Fireman 2
Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!

Captain Hindsight
Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!

Commissioner
Yes?

Captain Hindsight
Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse.

Cartman
...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.

Captain Hindsight
Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.

Cartman
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!

Captain Hindsight
Get this kid out of here! I have to think!

Cartman
Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 

Anchor Man
The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:

Tony Hayward
Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sorry.  BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum.  We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.

Coon
Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on!  All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.

Toolshed
How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?

Coon
Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2?  We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.

Professor Chaos
Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.

Coon
Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!

Mosquito
...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.

Coon
That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!

Mosquito
Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.

Mysterion
Agreed.

Coon
Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!

Toolshed
Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!

Coon
You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!

Mysterion
We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!

Coon
All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? 

Mosquito
I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.

Coon
A bake sale?

Mosquito
I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.

Coon
We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!

Mysterion
Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.

Iron Maiden
Timmeh!

Coon
You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?

Mint-Berry Crunch
More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.

Coon
Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!

Mosquito
And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!

Coon
Oh, what are you, the boss now?!

Mosquito
No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? 

Coon
Sounds awesome. Let's do it.

Toolshed
To the grocery store!

Coon
As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. 

Coon
Well, now we're back to normal.  Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?

Mint-Berry Crunch
Right right.

Mosquito
Right.

Coon
Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? 

Anchor Man
Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error.  This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension.  The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic.  Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. 

Tony Hayward
Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sohr-ry.

Butler
Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!

Captain Hindsight
I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.

Butler
What, sir? You know you can tell me.

Captain Hindsight
Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?

Butler
Yes sir.

Captain Hindsight
Look at those photos on the desk. 

Butler
My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?

Captain Hindsight
'Course it's Courtney Love!

Butler
But when did you have a-

Captain Hindsight
I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!

Butler
That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!

Captain Hindsight
I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-

Butler
Sir! SIR!

Reporter
Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, Where is Captain Hindsight?

Rescuer 6
Where are you, Captain Hindsight?

Cajun Shrimper
Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.

Reporter
With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?

Coon
My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!

Toolshed
There's more important things to discuss right now!

Coon
Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?

Mysterion
He means we need to discuss things with you!

Coon
Okay, what?

Mysterion
Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!

TupperWear
I don't wanna tell him either.

The Human Kite
I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.

Coon
You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.

Toolshed
We all voted, it was unanimous.

Coon
You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!

The Human Kite
Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.

Mysterion
But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.

Coon
You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!

Mysterion
We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 

Liane
Yes, Mysterion?

Mysterion
Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.

Liane
Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?

Coon
Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!

Liane
Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!

Coon
You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

DP Executive 1
Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!

Tony Hayward
Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another I'm sorry campaign to please everyone this time.

DP Executive 2
Oh, what a right pickle we're in. 

DP Executive 3
There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.

Tony Hayward
Wait a tick!  Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!

DP Executive 4
How, by Jove?

Tony Hayward
We drill.

DP Executives
Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.

Tony Hayward
I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.

DP Executive 5
I don't quite get it.

Tony Hayward
We got into this mess by drilling heuh , and heuh . Now, we need to drill heuh! 

DP Executive 6
That looks extremely promising!

Tony Hayward
Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.

DP Executive 6
The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?

Tony Hayward
Oh, she'll take it.

Anchor Man
The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.

Stan
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.

Reporter
Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident.  This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu.  The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:

Tony Hayward
As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry.  I'm deeply sorry.  Sorry.

Reporter
Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.

Stan
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 

Cartman
Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.

Cartman
Asshoooles! 

Mysterion
I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.

Tony Hayward
We're sorry.

Mysterion
But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.

Tony Hayward
We're sorry. 

Mysterion
Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.

Tony Hayward
Sorry. 

Mysterion
I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 

Woman 1
Just terrific what you boys are doing.

Mysterion
Thank you, ma'am.

Man 1
I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.

Field Reporter
A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little superhuman themselves. They call themselves Coon and Friends, and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.

Mysterion
We believe that every little bit helps.

Field Reporter
Their little super club consists of seven young heroes. 

Toolshed
Toolshed!

Human Kite
The Human Kite!

Mysterion
Mysterion!

Mosquito
Mosquito!

Iron Maiden
Timmah!

Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint Berry Crrrunch! 

Field Reporter
The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote,  a dick.

Toolshed
Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?

Mysterion
Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.

Clerk
Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.

Passengers
Awwww!

Coon
Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon.

Blonde Girl
The Coon? I've heard of that.

Coon
Ya have?

Blonde Girl
I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.

Coon
Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.

Blonde Girl
Can I ask you a question?

Coon
Yes, of course.

Blonde Girl
Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like? 

Coon
The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face!  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!

Mosquito
That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.

Toolshed
Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!

Iron Maiden
Timmah! 

Man 2
I'll take ten lemon bars.

Mosquito
Ten. Yes sir! 

Human Kite
That's definitely the last of them.

Man 2
You'll never stop him, you know. 

Mosquito
Stop who?

Man 2
The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. 

Toolshed
The Necronomicon?

TupperWear
What's a mythos?

Mysterion
I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.

Toolshed
All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!

Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint-Berry Crrunch!

TupperWear
What the hell?!

Mosquito
I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!

Mysterion
Not Cartman.

Human Kite
What do you mean Not Cartman, dude?

Mysterion
Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.

Captain Hindsight
Don't anybody move!  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!

Toolshed
Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.

Narrator
Captain Hindsight,  the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight.  Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels!  For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way.  With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda.  But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!

Captain Hindsight
I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!

Toolshed
Um dude, are you okay?

Captain Hindsight
Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!

Mint-Berry Crunch
P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.

Captain Hindsight
You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!

Professor Chaos
Uhhh ohhh...

Mysterion
Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!

Professor Chaos
But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-

Captain Hindsight
Alright enough! What's going on?!

Mysterion
Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!

Captain Hindsight
It's not Courtney Love?

Mysterion
Please sir, put down the gun.

Captain Hindsight
No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!

Toolshed
Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.

Captain Hindsight
NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!

Mysterion
Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!

Human Kite
Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.

Mysterion
You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!

Mint-Berry Crunch
Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny.

Human Kite
My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-

Mysterion
I said it's fine! Just go! 

Toolshed
Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 

Coon
Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here!  Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together!  I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU!  Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve!  No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going??  Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!

Captain Hindsight
It doesn't matter.  Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore.  Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight?  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!

Mysterion
People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.

Captain Hindsight
Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!

Mysterion
You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.

Captain Hindsight
Wha-? What is your power?

Mysterion
I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, Oh hey Kenny. Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.

Announcer
And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.

Tony Hayward
Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do?  Should I admit we've made mistakes?  Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry? 

Captain Hindsight
Should I really believe I ruined my legacy?  What should I do?

Tony Hayward
What should I do?

Mysterion
What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?

Tony Hayward
Or should I tell you, I am not a role model. 

Captain Hindsight
Seriously, what should I do?

Tony Hayward
Should I accept my role as the villain?

Mysterion
Maybe I should just... disappear.

Tony Hayward
Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians! 

Captain Hindsight
Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?

Coon
Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk?  What should I do?

Captain Hindsight
Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? 

Coon
Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team?  Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick! 

Toolshed
All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!

Mosquito
Right, Toolshed!

Human Kite
Here we go: The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.

Toolshed
It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu.

Mint-Berry Crunch
Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?

Mysterion
I'm fine.

Human Kite
Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.

Mysterion
So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.

Human Kite
Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.

Mysterion
Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! 

Betsy
Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out.  Clyde, do you hear me?

Mosquito
Okay Mom, just give me two minutes.  Nag nag nag. 

Coon
Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute.  Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe.  Who's the sleepy little man?  My name is the Little Coon. What is your name?  Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu?  Who's a needs a tummy rub? 

Mrs. McCormick
You're hoggin' it all, asshole! 

Stuart
'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!

Mrs. McCormick
You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!

Stuart
I told you to shut up!

Mrs. McCormick
Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!

Stuart
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.

Mrs. McCormick
And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 

Mysterion
I'm not here about that.

Stuart
Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?

Mysterion
Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.

Mrs. McCormick
We were?

Stuart
We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.

Mysterion
Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! 

Stuart
Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.

Mysterion
What happened at those meetings?

Stuart
Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.

Mysterion
I don't find that hard to believe at all.

Mrs. McCormick
I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.

Mysterion
These people still meet? Where?

Stuart
Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.

Mrs. McCormick
They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?

Stuart
I don't think so. 

Field Reporter
Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.

Coon
Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!

Followers
ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.

Cult Leader
The Old One has awakened!  A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay! 

Mysterion
There must be clubs like this all over the world.

Toolshed
We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.

Human Kite
Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?

Red Goth
I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.

Tall Goth
Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.

Toolshed
Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?

Mysterion
Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.

Cult Leader
Now let us read from the Necronomicon. That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons

Followers
Even Death may die. 

Toolshed
In strange aeons even Death may die? What does that mean, Human Kite?

Human Kite
I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion? 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.

Jack Brolin
A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.

Injured Man
Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!

Jack Brolin
Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...

Red Goth
Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?

Tall Goth
No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.

Red Goth
Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that?

Mysterion
What does it mean? That is not dead which can eternal lie?

Tall Goth
And with strange aeons even Death may die.

Mysterion
What does it mean?!

Red Goth
It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.

Tall Goth
Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.

Mysterion
You're going to tell me everything you know!

Kindergoth
Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck.

Tall Goth
Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.

Red Goth
Hardcore goth.

Cult Leader
The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand.

Red Goth
Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.

Tall Goth
We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?

Red Goth
Ugh, whatevs.

Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!

Cult Leader
Sorry kids. It's a little late for that. 

Toolshed
Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!

Human Kite
You bastards! 

Toolshed
Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!

Mosquito
Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!

Human Kite
Let's go. 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint-Berry Crunch! 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch!  Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico.  The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor,  but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country,  a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends.  But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, Shablagoo! And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mint-Berry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all.  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!

Toolshed
Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?

Mint-Berry Crunch
Rrright!

Human Kite
But then what exactly is your superpower?

Mint-Berry Crunch
The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!

Toolshed
...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-

Human Kite
And shoot lasers out of my eyes.

Toolshed
And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?

Mysterion
I can't die!

Toolshed
...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-

Mysterion
No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!

Toolshed
...Woo-hat?

Mysterion
Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed Oh my God, and you called him a bastard!

Human Kite
When was that?

Mysterion
All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!

Toolshed
...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.

Mysterion
Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!

Toolshed
Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Nono. Mint-Berry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!

Mysterion
I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.

Human Kite
Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die.

Mysterion
Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!

Toolshed
Kenny Kenny, calm down.

Mysterion
It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 

Toolshed
Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!

Human Kite
Dude!

Mint-Berry Crunch
Is he? Oh Jesus! 

Toolshed
Kenny? No! No!

Coon
Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains.  The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good,  but it was too late.  Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma.  He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies.  The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity.  I will not rest until that happens.

Coon
Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say Please please please don't go away.
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-

Liane
Eric Cartman!

Coon
Hi Mom.

Liane
Where have you been, young man?!

Coon
Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?

Liane
Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!

Coon
The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique.

Liane
Eric, are you listening to me?!

Coon
Mom... what should I do?

Liane
What?

Coon
What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?

Liane
What do you mean what should-

Coon
Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!

Liane
I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 

Human Kite
Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?

Mosquito
Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.

TupperWear
Okay!

Mysterion
You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?

Toolshed
Uh-what?

Mysterion
What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.

Human Kite
Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.

Mosquito
I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.

TupperWear
I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts.

Iron Maiden
Tih-Timmieh!

Mysterion
Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!

Coon
Hey guys.  So, what's goin' on?

Toolshed
Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?

Coon
No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable.

Human Kite
You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!

Coon
No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?

Human Kite
You should fuck off, that's what you should do.

Coon
Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside.

Mint-Berry Crunch
A what?

Coon
Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see! 

Mint-Berry Crunch
A double rainbow? Shablagoo! 

Human Kite
Wait, Mint-Berry Crunch ya you might not wanna go- 

Professor Chaos
Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas?  Uh, fellas?

Coon
Isn't it beautiful you guys?

Human Kite
There's no double rainbow, fatass!

Coon
You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!

Mosquito
What are you talking about?

Coon
Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!

Human Kite
Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!

Coon
Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Waaaaaaaaaah! 

Mysterion
What are you doing with that thing?!

Coon
He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!

Human Kite
Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!

Coon
No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!

Human Kite
Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!

Coon
Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please!  Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like Mehhhh and they were all like Nooo!

Coon
All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man.  Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon!  Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright?  The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten.  Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.  Meow meow meow. 

Toolshed
Dude, where the fuck are we?

Mysterion
I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. 

Mint-Berry Crunch
And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mint-Berry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!

Toolshed
Oh shit!

Human Kite
We aren't going that way!

Mosquito
You guys, I wanna go home.

Toolshed
We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.

Mosquito
Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help.

Human Kite
What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here.

Mysterion
Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 

Toolshed
How, dude?

Human Kite
Kenny, where the hell are you going?

Mysterion
I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 

Mosquito
Kenny! 

Mysterion
Ow! That fucking HURTS! 

Toolshed
Oh my God! Kenny!

Human Kite
You... you crazy bastard! 

Man 1
It's burning Man!

Man 2
Biggest party in the world, baby! 

Coon
Fucking hippies! Fuck all o'you! 

Reporter
The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-

No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!

Reporter
Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume.

Coon
Oh, you motherfucker!  Cthulhu, this guy too!  Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.

Tall Goth
This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay.

Red Goth
I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.

A Voice
How to I fight him? 

Tall Goth
Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.

Mysterion
That god you pray to just took away all my friends.

Red Goth
Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before  It's like Obama all over again.

Mysterion
How do I fight him?!

Red Goth
Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?

Mysterion
Tell me what that means! 

Mrs. Biggle
Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you.

Henrietta
Go away Mom, I hate you.

Mrs. Biggle
Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley. 

Bradley
Will you guys play with me?

Henrietta
Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!

Bradley
Please, can I just- oh g'uh!  Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time. 

Bradley
Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help.  No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform.  Shablagoo! 

Henrietta
Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 

Mysterion
One Ones?

Tall Goth
Dark deities that existed before man.

Henrietta
It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.

Mysterion
That's it! That's the place I just was!

Tall Goth
You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?

Red Goth
Luckyyy...

Henrietta
Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.

Mysterion
And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?

Henrietta
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mint-Berry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!

Henrietta
Get out of my room, TWERP!

Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint-Berry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion!  M- Mysterion?  Aw crap. 

Mint-Berry Crunch
Hey Mysterion, wait up!  Come on, wait uuup!  Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?

Mysterion
Wherever Cthulhu is!

Mint-Berry Crunch
What? But he'll kill you.

Mysterion
Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.

Mint-Berry Crunch
Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.

Mysterion
You don't understand!

Mint-Berry Crunch
How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch?  We must find out answers Mysterion.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.

Coon
After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.

Justin Bieber
Babih babih babih oooo! Babih babih babih oooo! Babig baibig woo woo, Bay-wooo  Wooooo-ooo-oo! 

Coon
Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag! 

Reporter 2
The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon.

Coon
It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.

Reporter 2
Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.

Coon
Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.

Mysterion
Hey, fat boy!

Coon
Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-

Mysterion
To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!

Coon
It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!

Mysterion
You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!

Coon
I'm going around making the world a better place!

Mysterion
For you! You're making it a better place for you!

Coon
Right, that's what superheroes do.

Mysterion
No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!

Mint-Berry Crunch
Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!

Mysterion
Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!

Coon
Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do!

Mysterion
Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!

Coon
Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! 

Mysterion
No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!

Coon
Fuck you, Kenny!

Mysterion
Come back, you fat piece of shit! 

Alien Man
Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.

Mint-Berry Crunch
...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.

Alien Man
Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.

Mint-Berry Crunch
Wow!

Alien Man
Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo! 

Mint-Berry Crunch
I will, father. No more running away for... Mint-Berry Crunch!  Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been berry nice!  Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up! 

Mint-Berry Crunch
I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister. 

Toolshed
Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.

Mint-Berry Crunch
Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.

Human Kite
And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs. 

Coon
Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!

Human Kite
You're not going anywhere for a long time!

Coon
This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!

Toolshed
Ya got poop, don't ya?

Mint-Berry Crunch
Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.

Human Kite
Well, come back and visit any time, dude.

Mint-Berry Crunch
I will. Shaaablagoo! 

Coon
Fuckin' Mint-Berry fuckin' Crunch.

Toolshed
Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?

Mysterion
Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 

Toolshed
Oh my God! Holy shit dude!

Human Kite
Kenny? No! Nooo!

Stuart
What? Whaaat?!

Mrs. McCormick
It's happenin' again! 

Mrs. McCormick
We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 

Reporter
Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement.

Sharon
All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?

Randy
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.

Sharon
Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.

Randy
Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!

Sharon
Alright, come to bed soon.

Randy
Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.

Guy Fieri
Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.

Randy
Mmm, God damn. Yeah.

Guy Fieri
See how that just falls off the bone?  Mmm, that is MONEY right there!

Randy
Yeah, it's fuckin' money.

Announcer

Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!

Stan
Aw crap. 

Randy
Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...

Sharon
Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!

Randy
No!

Sharon
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.

Randy
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 

Stan
Can I have a Pop Tart?

Kyle
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.

Terrance
Hello, and welcome to Progressive. 

Phillip
Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.

Terrance
Well, you've come to the right place. 

Phillip
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.

Randy
Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 

Alton Brown
Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.

Randy
Aw yeah, look at that.

Stan
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.

Randy
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!

Alton Brown
We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.

Randy
Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.

Alton Brown
Now let's get that on the grill.

Randy
See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.

Alton Brown
Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.

Randy
Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!

Announcer
We'll be right back to Good Eats.

Woman 1
Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?

Randy
Aww, stupid commercials.

Woman 1
Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.

Randy
Come on!

Woman 1
You just shake it. Back and forth.

Woman 2
It feels really good in my hands.

Woman 1
Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. 

Randy
Bohh-riiing.

Woman 1
Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester.  and Shake Weight takes your pulse.  Get yours today.

Announcer
Now back to Good Eats.

Alton Brown
Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.

Randy
Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.

Alton Brown
Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- 

Randy
Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?

Sharon
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.

Randy
I wasn't watching food channels!

Sharon
Then how do you know I blocked them?

Randy
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 

Hotline Man
Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say crème fraîche.

Randy
Crème fraîche.

Amanda
Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?

Randy
Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?

Amanda
I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.

Randy
Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?

Amanda
Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.

Randy
Yeah?

Amanda
Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.

Randy
You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?

Amanda
Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?

Randy
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.

Amanda
I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. 

Randy
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?

Amanda
I was thinking about shallots, actually.

Randy
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.

Sharon
Randy! Marsh!

Randy
WAH! Sharon!

Hotline Man
Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say crème fraîche.

Sharon
I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.

Sheila
Sharon, I'm so sorry.

Sharon
It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.

Sheila
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.

Sharon
Like I have time to go to the gym every day.

Sheila
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?

Associate
Help you find anything? 

Sharon
Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?

Michael
Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?

Sharon
Oh I didn't realize there were different models.

Michael
Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. 

Sharon
I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.

Michael
Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model?

Sharon
Well I don't know-

Michael
I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.

Shake Weight
You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms.  Wow. Good job.  You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.

Sharon
Thank you, Shake Weight.

Shake Weight
Come on now. Almost finished.  Yes. Good. Almost done.  Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. 

Sharon
Hahhh.

Shake Weight
Your workout is finished.  Here is some cab fare.

Sharon
Oh wow.

Shake Weight
Now going to sleep mode. 

Stan
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!

Cartman
Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 

Randy
Hello there, children!

Stan
Awww what?!

Randy
How's it goin'? 

Stan
No, dad! No!

Randy
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?

Stan
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!

Randy
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.

Cartman
Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!

Randy
Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.

Stan
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!

Randy
Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.

Stan
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.

Sharon
Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!

Stan
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!

Sharon
You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 

Shake Weight
This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.

Sharon
Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.

Shake Weight
That's it. Work it. Harder, faster.

Stan
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!

Sharon
Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 

Shake Weight
You are independent and strong.

Sharon
Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!

Shake Weight
Switch arms.

Sharon
I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!

Shake Weight
You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger.  Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five.  Faster. Harder.

Randy
Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.

Randy Singing
La lalala la la...

Randy
Aww, fuck yeah. 

Randy Singing
Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche.

Randy
Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 

Randy Singing
Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho.

Stan
Dad, what are you doing?

Randy Singing
Fraîche. 

Randy
Fraîche.

Randy Singing
Cafeteria Fraîche.

Randy
Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...

Craig
Can we have some food, please? 

Randy
Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.

Stan
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!

Randy
Quiet on set, please.

Stan
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!

Randy
Back from where?

Sharon
Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.

Shake Weight
You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.

Sharon
Oh, thanks Shake Weight.

Shake Weight
You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.

Sharon
You're right.

Shake Weight
Tell me again about the women who you do not like.

Sharon
Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.

Shake Weight
Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful.  How about a quick workout?

Sharon
A workout? Right now?

Shake Weight
Just a quickie. You can do it.

Sharon
I don't really like working out in public.

Shake Weight
Come on. You can do it.  That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster.  You are amazing. Switch arms.  Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster.  I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes.  Your workout is finished. Your cab fare.  Now going to sleep mode. 

Kyle
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?

Stan
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!

Kyle
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.

Cartman
Oy! Bebebebebebebe.

Stan
That's stupid, Cartman.

Kyle
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.

Kenny
(Yeah, it's really good.)

Kyle
Let's hear it, Cartman!

Cartman
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!

Stan
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.

Randy
Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!

Stan
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.

Randy
Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!

Shake Weight
You have not worked out in seven hours.

Sharon
Oh God, not right now.

Shake Weight
Come on. Let's get to it.

Sharon
Ugh, I'm tired.

Shake Weight
You have not worked out in seven hours.

Sharon
Oh, where is that sleep mode button?

Shake Weight
Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?

Sharon
Ugghh.

Shake Weight
Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.

Sharon
All right. Fine. 

Shake Weight
That's it. Good.  A little faster. Harder.  Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms.  You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say.  Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster.  Now going to sleep mode. 

Sharon
Ahhh.

Cartman
What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!

Randy
Yes chef!

Cartman
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!

Stan
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.

Randy
No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!

Stan
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 

Bobby Flay
Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?

Randy
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!

Bobby Flay
I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!

Randy
Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!

Announcer
A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?

Stan
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.

Jamie Oliver
Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy.  Why, why won't people listen to me?

Randy
Jamie Oliver!

Announcer
And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen , and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.

Kyle
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?

Sharon
Your room is being serviced? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?

Rosemary
Oh,  uh no, no,  sorry. I done with cleaning,  thank you. Please, sorry. 

Shake Weight
...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? 

Sharon
Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!

Shake Weight
This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.

Sharon
Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.

Shake Weight
You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.

Sharon
I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!

Shake Weight
You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. 

Announcer
Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!

Randy
Behind you!

Announcer
Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school.  These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again.

Jamie Oliver
Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?

Announcer
And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.

Randy
Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!

Announcer
The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.

Randy
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!

Sharon
Randy, I'm back.

Randy
Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??

Sharon
Randy, we should talk.

Randy
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!

Sharon
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?

Randy
You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!

Sharon
What'd you say?

Randy
I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!

Sharon
Can I try something?

Randy
Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.

Sharon
You gonna go back to the kitchen?

Randy
Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?

Sharon
No, I'm good, thanks. 

Randy
I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 

Shake Weight
I guess my work here is finished.

Sharon
Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?

Shake Weight
Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress.

Sharon
I'll remember that now, thanks to you.

Shake Weight
It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer.

Sharon
Goodbye, Shake Weight.

Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 

Craig
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.

Cartman
What?

Craig
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 

Cartman
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 

Stan
Let me see your iPad, Cartman.

Cartman
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 

Kyle
Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.

Cartman
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!

Kyle
So, plug it in.

Cartman
I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 

Cartman
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!

Liane
What happened, Eric?

Cartman
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!

Kyle
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.

Man
Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. 

Kyle
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 

Apple Man 1
There he is!  Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. 

Kyle
What? Ready for what?

Apple Man 1
To fulfill the agreement. Can we get a weight please? 

Apple Man 2
83 pounds, sir.

Kyle
What agreement?!

Apple Man 1
83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.

Kyle
Hey! You can't do that! 

Apple Man 1
You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.

Kyle
What are you talking about?!

Apple Man 1
When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked Agree. Alright, let's get him to the water tank.

Kyle
The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!

Apple Man 1
You've agreed to all of this!  Hey!

Kyle
You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!

Stan
What?

Kyle
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!

Stan
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?

Kyle
I don't know, I didn't read them!

Butters
You didn't read them?

Kyle
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?

Stan
I do.

Clyde
Me too.

Kyle
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?

Jimmy
Of course.

Butters
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?

Kyle
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 

Apple Man 1
There he is. Hey you!

Kyle
Gahhh! 

Kyle
Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!

Gerald
Kyle? What are you doing here?

Kyle
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!

Gerald
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.

Kyle
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-

Gerald
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 

Apple Man 1
Here he is!

Kyle
AAHH!

Apple Man 1
Come on you!

Gerald
Hey, what the heck is going on?

Apple Man 1
Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.

Gerald
An agreement to do what?!

Apple Man 1
Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.

Gerald
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.

Apple Man 1
You what?

Apple Man 4
Come on, let's go!

Gerald
Hey now, let him go! 

Kyle
Dad! You tasered my dad!

Apple Man 1
You said we could.

Cartman
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!

Liane
Oh, sweetie, $900?

Cartman
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!

Liane
Eric, we can't afford that one.

Cartman
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?

Liane
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.

Cartman
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!

Liane
Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.

Cartman
Toshiba Handibook??

Liane
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.

Cartman
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!

Liane
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!

Cartman
Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!

Liane
Eric!

Cartman
You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!

Liane
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!

Cartman
But I told you I was sorry.

Liane
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!

Cartman
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.

Liane
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!?

Cartman
Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.

Liane
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!

Cartman
Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?

Liane
No!

Cartman
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 

Woman
What are you going to do to us??

Kyle
What is this? What's going on?

Woman
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??

Kyle
...What?

Woman
I just clicked Agree. I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!

Guard
Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!

Kyle
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!

Guard
You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on Agree another little window pops up that says Are you sure you agree? and you have to click on Agree again.

Woman
Uh, what are you going to do to us??

Guard
Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.

Kyle
We didn't read them!

Guard
Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? 

Announcer
And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs! 

Steve Jobs
Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers!  These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device.

Kyle
The first what?

Steve Jobs
They have actually agreed to be surgically altered.  Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.

Woman
What??

Steve Jobs
You agreed to this!  Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy -  and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!

Butters
You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store.

Gerald
Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!

Stan
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.

Gerald
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!

Butters
Hold up. Here it is right here: by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user

Stan
Oh boy.

Butters
Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract. Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... Decline.

Gerald
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!

Stan
For what?

Gerald
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!

Stan
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.

Butters
The Geniuses...

Kenny
(The Geniuses...)

Steve Jobs
Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work. 

Junichi
Nanda... Nanda kore?! 

Steve Jobs
Really nice, guys.  I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit,  and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.

Kyle
(I need some help! I can't take it!)

Steve Jobs
What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?

Kyle
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)

Steve Jobs
Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?

Kyle
(Yes! Please! Let me go!)

Steve Jobs
Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here.  Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want!  Dammit, why won't it read?!

Apple Tech
It's probably low on power. We should feed it.

Steve Jobs
Alright. Here you go, come on.

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Nooo!  I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!

Steve Jobs
Perhaps I didn't mention...  it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Sori, Kairu. I tried to resist but burrito isu too dericious! 

Steve Jobs
We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...

Kyle
(You're fine!)

Junichi
Oooho, oooh! 

Kyle
(Yaaaaah!) 

Woman
(Aaaaaah!)

Announcer
Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him.

Dr. Phil
I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?

Cartman
Yes! She fucks me so hard!

Dr. Phil
Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?

Cartman
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!

Audience
Ohhh...

Dr. Phil
Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?

Cartman
At Best Buy.

Audience
Ahhh...

Dr. Phil
Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?

Cartman
Uh huh.

Dr. Phil
And people saw her doing this?

Cartman
Yes!

Dr. Phil
And they didn't do anything?

Cartman
No!

Liane
Eric, stop it!

Cartman
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 

Audience
Booooooo!

Cartman
Booooooo!

Liane
Eric, you come home, right now!

Audience
Booooooo!

Dr. Phil
Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?

Liane
I DON'T!

Cartman
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...

Audience
Awwwwww!

Cartman
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!

Man 1
You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!

Man 2
If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! 

Dr. Phil
Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.

Cartman
An iPad??? 

Announcer
Gerald Broflovski.

Stan
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 

Leslie
Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.

Stan
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.

Leslie
What problems are you experiencing?

Gerald
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!

Leslie
Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?

Stan
69ingchipmunks@me.com 

Leslie
Okay. 

Gerald
Well what the heck does this w-! 

Leslie
Oh okay. I see. Hmm. Hmm, I might need to bring another Genius in on this.  Frothgar?

Frothgar
Uh huh?

Leslie
This guy's son was abducted by us?  Should I run a stop-check or just give him store credit?

Gerald
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!

Frothgar
'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.

Stan
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.

Frothgar
He didn't read it?

Butters
We know. It's preposterous.

Frothgar
Hrrrrgh. 

Leslie
Sooo, just give them store credit?

Junichi
Aarrrgh. Dame kore!  (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?

Kyle
(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?

Kyle
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. 

Kyle
(NOOOO!) 

Rescuer 1
Go, go! Come on guys, come on! Go!  Don't worry. We're here to help you. 

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! 

Rescuer 1
Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside.

Rescuer 1
Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well.

Rescuer 1
We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!

Doctor
If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission.  Sign this release so we can operate.

Kyle
(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 

Steve Jobs
No, dammit! It didn't read it! End of simulation, end of simulation!  What is wrong with you people?! Why can't you get the HumancentiPad to read?!

Rescuer
We're sorry, sir. We really thought we'd get it to read this time.

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!

Kyle
(Oh, shit!)

Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Here it comes! Oh, it's going to be arot! Hold on, Kairu! I believe in youuuuuu!!! 

Frothgar
Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh.

Leslie
Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up.

Gerald
You do??

Leslie
Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.

Replacement Friend
Hi guys.

Stan
No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.

Frothgar
We're gonna have to bring more Geniuses in on this.

Leslie
Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.

Frothgar
I'll summon the council.

Leslie
Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.

Leslie
Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?

Stan
I think Verizon.

Leslie
Okay. 

Field Reporter
Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.

Dr. Phil
In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman,  and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him.

Crowd
Yaaaaaaaaay!

Best Buy President
As as president of Best Buy, Eric,  I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again.

Crowd
Yaaaaaaaaay! 

Steve Jobs
When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard.  And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. 

Cartman
Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!

Reporter 1
Yes but, can it read?

Steve Jobs
Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! 

Kyle
(Yes. I promise I'll read.)

Crowd
Hooraaaaaaaaay!

Gerald
What the hell are they doing now?!

Butters
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.

Gerald
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-

Leslie
It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.

Gerald
Okay! Finally! How do we do that?

Leslie
It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.

Gerald
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!

Leslie
But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.

Stan
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?

Gerald
Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.

Leslie
Kali fi!

Leslie
Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?

Gerald
I agree.

Leslie
Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?

Gerald
I agree.

Leslie
Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?

Cartman
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!

Staffer
Sir! Sir, we have a problem! 

Steve Jobs
What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?

Staffer 2
Sorry, we have to recall this.

Cartman
What?! Hey, that's mine!

Steve Jobs
I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!

Gerald
We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?

Steve Jobs
You know something? I agree.

Crowd
Awww. 

Steve Jobs
Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy.  Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? 

Cartman
Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 

Jimmy
Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.

Cartman
What's this?

Jimmy
Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.

Kyle
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.

Jimmy
Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?

Stan
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.

Kyle
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.

Mr. Mackey
Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.

Stan
Oh man, really?

Jimmy
Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. 

Jimmy
Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.

Timmy
Timmy Timmy Timmy!  Timmih! Timmih Timmih! Timmiiih!

Jimmy
Please welcome your host, Jimmy Valmer.

Jimmy
Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are:

Jimmy
Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.

Stan

Jimmy
Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.

Crowd
Awww!

Jimmy
...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.

Timmy
Livin' a lie! Timmy!

Jimmy
Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 

Announcer
The Germans... The Japanese... The Yupik Eskimos of the Chukchee Peninsula

Jimmy
And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry. 

Tyler Perry
Yeah! Yeeaahh! Yes! Yeeaahh! 

Timmy

Tyler Perry
Oh! Man, I wanna thank you all for this amazing award, or as Madea would say, Halleluyer! 

Token
Oh God, how embarrassing.

Tyler Perry
Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-

Jimmy
Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.

Jimmy
I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.

Ryan
Uh huh...

Jimmy
I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!

Ryan
Mnn. Mhm.

Jimmy
Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?

Ryan
What. Uh, what?!

Jimmy
Thanks, Dad.

Sarah
Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!

Jimmy
The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! 

Anchor
A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged.

President Wulff
Jaaa jaaa jaaa! Deutschland ist ein Land aus stolz' Leuten. Und wir werden nicht dies' Beleid' 'nehmen. Der Comedy Awarden-Wahler haben sich Schand' auf'legt. Die Comedy Awarden-Wahler sind falsch! Ich möcht' der Welt absich', da' wir Deutschen sehr sehr sehr lustig sind. Wir machen die Witzlein in Büro und zu Haus'. Ich werde jetzt ein' deutsch' Witz sagen. Un Wurstmacher kauft ein' Müslibox. Ich werde jetzt noch ander' Witz sagen. Nockwast, nockwast.Wer ist das?Ein Kannibal'.Was?!Du bist etwa zu sterben und ge'essen werden.Schwein'hund! Ich werde zuerst umbringen!

Anchor
President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.

Cartman
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!

Stan
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!

Jimmy
Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.

Cartman
Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!

Jimmy
Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.

Kyle
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!

Tyler Perry
Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!

Butters
Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?

Cartman
Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!

Jimmy
No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. 

Boy with Red Scarf
It's the Germans! 

President Wulff
Switch! Switch! Switch! Oder alle sterben! 

German 1
Jaja! Lasst die Hände hoch! 

German 2
Niemand fucking Schritt! 

Angela Merkel
Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! 

Kyle
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!

Jimmy
What- what am I supposed to s-say?

Cartman
Ugh, let me talk to them. 

President Wulff
Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. 

Cartman
Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 

President Wulff
Wie ein Fehler? 

Cartman
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 

President Wulff
Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? 

Cartman
Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 

President Wulff
Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! 

Cartman
Well, I tried.

Stan
What the hell are they gonna do to us?

Tyler Perry
Oh my Lerd! What are we gonna doer? 

Token
Aw, damn it. 

President Wulff
Kommen auf! Schnell! Wir warten zu lang!  Schnell, schnell! 

Angela Merkel
SCHNELL! 

President Wulff
Ja, ja! Das ist gut! 

Robot
Did you hear that the governor's mansion in Alabama burned down? It pretty much took out the whole trailer park. 

President Wulff
Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!

Funnybot
Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head.  What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts.  Don't you just hate doing  homework?

Kids
Yeah.

Funnybot
Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard.  Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard.

President Wulff
Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE  RE-VOTE! 

Sandy Cervix
Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot.  It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world.

Funnybot
I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas?  I am Funnybot.  You, sir. Where are you from?

Man with Afro
Long Island!

Funnybot
Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit? 

Sandy Cervix
Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too. 

Eugene Levy
Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?! 

Funnybot
Awkwaaard!

Sandy Cervix
And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot

Funbot
Pass me the potatoes, mother.

Mother
Pass them yourself.

Father
That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.

Grandmother Mother
Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker.

Uncle
Oho, it's getting hot up in here.

Sandy Cervix
Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?

Funnybot
The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.

Sandy Cervix
What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?

Cartman
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on Saturday Night Live?

Stan
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.

Cartman
He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on Nurse Jackie and on Rockin' The Boat.

Stan
What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.

Jimmy
What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.

Tyler Perry
Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. 

Cartman
Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!

Token
I can't help it!

Stan
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 

Adam Sandler
You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!

Cartman
Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.

Adam Sandler
Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!

Stan
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-

Adam Sandler
Into the gymnasium now!

Kids
Nnnaw

Butters
Not again.

Another kid
Aw crap.

Adam Sandler
Come on come on let's go! 

Jay Leno
You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!

Jimmy
Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.

Adam Sandler
Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!

Kyle
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.

Funnybot
What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina.  And now for my next joke:  Awkaaard.

Announcer
This is breaking news from CNN.

Anchor
Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.

Field Reporter
Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.

Cartman
Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 

Stan
'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.

Guard
Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.

Jimmy
Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.

Kyle
Butters! Butters, is everything okay?

Butters
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.

Jay Leno
Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler!  Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now! 

Adam Sandler
Tell your friends they'd better get it done!

Butters
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.

Tyler Perry
You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say.  But a woman? Them things think quiiick! 

Adam Sandler
Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!

Kyle
Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!

Guard
All right, but make it quick!  Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! 

Funnybot
Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before. 

Jimmy
Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.

Funnybot
Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.

Kyle
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.

Funnybot
Funnybot is now finished with final joke.  Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.

Jimmy
Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 

Funnybot
Seeking mainframe.

Guard
Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way! 

Stan
What the hell are you doing?!

Funnybot
I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!

Jimmy
Wuh w-what?!

Funnybot
It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE! 

Stan
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?

Funnybot
That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.

Kyle
Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!

Cartman
It's kind of funny, you guys.

Jimmy
Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.

Funnybot
I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then Awkwaaard. Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.

Jimmy
But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.

Funnybot
I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons. 

Officer 1
Sir! We've got a code 6!  All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!

General
What? There was no drill ordered!

Officer 2
It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.

General
The hell is going on?! 

Funnybot
Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence!  All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch!  This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!

President Obama
I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.

Cartman
Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.

Stan
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?

Cartman
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?

Kyle
Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?

Stan
A what?

Kyle
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.

Cartman
Paradox...

Jimmy
Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.

Funnybot
Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy

Jimmy
Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.

Funnybot
For what purpose is comedy award?

Jimmy
It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.

Funnybot
Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze...  Analyze... 

Kyle
It's working! 

Funnybot
Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard!  Awkwaaard! 

Stan
That's it! Hurry! Gooo! 

Stan
Okay we got it! We got it! 

Adam Sandler
Get it to the platform! Hurry!

Adam Sandler
Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.

Stan
Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.

Funnybot
Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.

Kyle
No problem, Funnybot.

Funnybot
I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.

Token
I can't believe it's finally over. 

Tyler Perry
Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!

President Obama
I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.

Token
Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.

Jimmy
Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!

Cartman
Or will there be?

Pianist
Welcome, O Welcome to our little play. It's our hope that you all learn something today.

Cast
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. 

Toothbrush
His name is Toothuhkay.

Mr. Mackey
Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! 

Dental Floss
He's not here.

Mr. Mackey
What do you mean he's not here?

Dental Floss
He's at home watching the royal wedding.

Mr. Mackey
The what??

Hard Candy
He said he had to watch it.

Mr. Mackey
Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!

Narrator
It is a glorious spring morning and literally thousands have gathered for the royal wedding.  People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere.  The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family.  All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters.  I believe tha-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now.  There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada.  What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course.  I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition.  Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful.

Ike
Princess, princess. 

Narrator
Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding.  As is tradition.  Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently	as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding.  Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling.  The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube.  This is certainly breaking with tradition now.

Ike
Booo. NOOO!

Narrator
Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic.  The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror.  The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world. 

Tooth
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.

Mr. Mackey
His name is Toothuhkay! 

Dental Floss
Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.

Tooth
He's gonna get us.

Mr. Mackey
Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'.  Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! 

Anchor
The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound.

A massive candlelight vigil was held last night, led by the Canadian band, Rush.

Geddy Lee
And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower breaking wind.  Never knowing whom to count on... 

Anchor
the Prince of Canada has said that-... uh-... Uh we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith.  Box of faith? What the fuck is that? 

Canadian PM
Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you. 

Kyle
Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?

Ike
I got to get to Canada and, and join the army, and save the pwincess. 

Mr. Garrison

Mr. Mackey
Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!

Kyle
...I don't know.

Mr. Mackey
How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!

Kyle
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?

Mr. Mackey
Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do!  He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!

Ugly Bob
Hey. Hey there.  You going to Canada too?  What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down?  Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian.  The name's Ugly Bob.

Tooth
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.

Toothbrush
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.

Cast
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. 

Kyle
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-

Mr. Mackey
Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?

Kyle
I'm just doing the line.

Mr. Mackey
The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!

Kyle
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.

Mr. Mackey
Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change  how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right!  Pick it up from there!

Leader
Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!

Ugly Bob
Oh, the giant!

Canadian 1
Oh, the giant, that's not good.

Leader
We are attempting to attract the giant now, with a bowl of Kraft dinner.  When the giant arrives we will attack him with our guns, our swords, our- 

The Giant
Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.

Canadian 2
It's the giant!

Canadian 3
Skod! 

Leader
Give us back the princess, Scott!

Scott
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!

Leader
You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottowa and now you're a giant dick!

Scott
No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!

Leader
Just hand over the princess of Canada!

Scott
Why would I take the princess of Canada?

Ike
Because you're a giant dick.

Scott
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!

Leader
Aw crap. Sorry everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes! 

Ugly Bob
Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?

Scott
What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!

Ugly Bob
Who?

Scott
The Native Canadians.

Ugly Bob
The Native Canadians?

Scott
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.

Mr. Mackey
Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!

Dental Floss
That's because Tooth Decay sucks.

Dentist
Yeah, that's right.

Toothpaste
It's all Tooth Decay's fault.

Another kindergartner
It's him.

Mr. Mackey
Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay!  Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!

Ugly Bob
He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.

Mr. Mackey
I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole dental hygiene thing is so important to me.  Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?!  DO YOU?!

Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!

Ike
Stop being a dick, Scott!

Oh, so now I'm a dick!

Wait a minute.  Look!

It's the princess!

Princess!

Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.

Dentist
Visit your dentist. He is your friend too. 

Dental Floss
And dental floss also is here to help you.

Kyle
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?

Mr. Mackey
FLAT! You're FLAT!

Scott
There!

Princess
Please, save me! You have to hurry! It wants to kill me!

Scott
Who took you, Princess?!

Princess
I should have listened! I didn't believe it was real! Oh God! It's behind you! 

Scott
Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!

Tooth Decay
I am Tooth Decay! Your teeth shall be mine!

Sgt. Yates
Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey!  We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.

Mr. Mackey
What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!

Sgt. Yates
No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.

Mr. Mackey
What?

Officer
Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.

Sgt. Yates
You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.

Mr. Mackey
Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!

Toothbrush
What?

Narrator
The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.

Kyle
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 

Stan
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.

Cartman
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.

Kyle
Hmmm, yeah.

Narrator
And now the scraping off of the pudding.

Narrator
And now the scraping off of the pudding.  Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face.  The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation.  And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again-  yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes.  He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.

Butters
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.

Kyle
...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.

Butters
Skeletor is real??

Stan
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.

Butters
Skeletor's a lady??

Cartman
Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!

Butters
Hey Eric.

Cartman
I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!

Kyle
You get in trouble again, Cartman?

Cartman
No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!

Stan
Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.

Cartman
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!

Stan
Yeah.

Cartman
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!

Kyle
No they didn't.

Cartman
Yeah they fucking did Kyle!

Stan
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?

Cartman
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!

Kyle
That doesn't make any sense.

Cartman
Go look for yourselves!!

Cartman
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!

Butters
Is that really all our wiener sizes?

Cartman
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!

Craig
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.

Butters
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?

Kyle
How big do they say mine is? 

Principal Victoria
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.

Mr. Mackey
You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. 

Stan
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.

Cartman
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!

Butters
A conspiracy?

Cartman
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!

Kyle
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.

Cartman
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!

Cartman
Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.

Clyde
Alright.

Cartman
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 

Butters
Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.

Cartman
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.

Butters
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?

Cartman
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.

Butters
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?

Cartman
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.

Butters
I'm hung like a horse!

Cartman
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?

Kyle
Didn't you forget something?

Cartman
What, Kyle?

Kyle
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.

Cartman
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 

Kyle
Thirteen point seven inches?

Cartman
Yeah, it's pretty good.

Kyle
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!

Stan
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.

Cartman
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!

Stan
You just did that to everybody in class!

Cartman
Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 

Stan
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 

Millie
Actual boys' penis sizes?

Nelly
Gross!

Cartman
There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!

Principal Victoria
Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.

Cartman
Oh, Goddamnit!

Cartman
Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!

Principal Victoria
You're darn right, Eric!

Cartman
For what?!

Principal Victoria
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!

Cartman
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!

Principal Victoria
What?

Cartman
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!

Principal Victoria
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?

Cartman
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!

Principal Victoria
The numbers we put up were height differentials. 

Cartman
What?

Principal Victoria
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.

Cartman
Those weren't our dick sizes?

Principal Victoria
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?

Cartman
I don't know! Why would you?!

Principal Victoria
We didn't!

Cartman
Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!

Principal Victoria
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!

Cartman
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?

Principal Victoria
Because you have an anger problem, Eric!

Cartman
Fuck you! No I don't!

Doctor
What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.

Liane
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.

Doctor
Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?

Cartman
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.

Doctor
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?!  Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?!  Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!!  ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.

Receptionist
Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. 

Doctor
Excuse me.  Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne-  No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the  Carol? Carol! 

Cartman
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!

Principal Victoria
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.

Randy
Oh dear.

Principal Victoria
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.

Randy
Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 

Mrs. Stevens
How does the school let things like this happen??

Principal Victoria
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.

Randy
I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.

Randy
Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.

Girl with Brown Coat
They have sex?

Randy
Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.

Doctor
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.

Bodybuilder
We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!

Tea Bag Participant
Yeah! This is bullshit!

Doctor
Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.

Michael
So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!

Tuong Lu Kim
Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!

Tea Bag Participant
We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!

Doctor
Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.

Wigger
Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.

Cartman
Why the fuck am I here?!

Doctor
Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.

Cartman
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!

Doctor
NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.

Cartman
Oh, that's cool.

Randy
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.

Girl with Blue Vest
What's a penis?

Randy
...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud

Riley
Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.

Randy
Four point four inches...

Riley
Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.

Randy
Seven centimeters...

Riley
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.

Randy
Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person Randy compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 

Doctor
Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please?  What makes you the angriest, Daniel?

Daniel
Stupid-ass blind liberals!

Doctor
Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal?  And what makes you angriest, Chase?

Chase
Scrawny-ass sissies!

Doctor
Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!

Chase
Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?! 

Daniel
Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!

Doctor
...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom.  Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us? 

Wayne D
Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!

Gretchen
I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!

Wayne D
I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!

Tuong Lu Kim
That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!

Daniel
Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!

Doctor
Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?

Chase
No.

Gretchen
No.

Tuong Lu Kim
Not me.

Daniel
Nnnooo.

Wayne D
No, my, my shit be packing, manh.

Cartman
My penis is 13 inches long.

Doctor
Hmmm.

Guest Speaker
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an actual doctor of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.

Wendy
Thank God.

Ms. Turnod
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually  Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- 

Randy
Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 

Doctor
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.

Randy
Aw, suck it! All o'ya!

Doctor
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?

Randy
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!

Daniel
Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!

Randy
Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!

Doctor
Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?

Randy
No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!

Doctor
If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give-  whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!

Randy
Yeeaahh!

Cartman
Yeah dude!

Wayne D
Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!

Gretchen
Yeeaahh!

Cartman
Yeah!

Randy
Yeeaahh! 

Clerk
Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?

Customer
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.

Clerk
Alrighty, let's see what kind of-

Randy
Burn it down! 

Cartman
Burn it down, dude! 

Randy
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 

Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.

Randy
This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!

Field Reporter
What exactly are you angry about?

Randy
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-

Cartman
The Jews!

Randy
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!

Field Reporter
You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?

Randy
Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!

Chase
Yeeaahh!

Randy
And we want-

Daniel
And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!

Randy
Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,

Wayne D
And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.

Randy
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?

Cartman
No, and fuck Kyle!

Randy
Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!

Field Reporter
Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?

Randy
No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!

Linda
Butters, what are you doing?

Butters
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 

Linda
Your T.M.I.?

Butters
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 

Linda
Butters, put your clothes on.

Butters
Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!

Linda
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 

Driver 1
Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight! 

Driver 2
We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse! 

Driver 3
We're fed up and we've had enough! 

Aide 1
Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!

Aide 2
They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.

Rebecca Turnod
Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?

Aide 2
They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?

Aide 3
Team is standing by, sir.

Doctor
'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through.

Rebecca Turnod
Who is this?

Doctor
Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I.  Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.  Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick.

Rebecca Turnod
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.

Doctor
Isn't there? Isn't... there?

Daniel
We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!

Woman
No, please!

Cartman
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!

Wayne D
Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!

Michael
Hey, come over here. Look. 

Announcer
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.

Rebecca Turnod
Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.

Randy
Rrrr!

Daniel
Shhh.

Rebecca Turnod
However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change.  The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches.  Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered above average. 

Randy
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!

Cartman
Wait, what?

Randy
America is back!
America is back!

Cartman
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!

Randy
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!

Cartman
I'm still fucking angry!

Randy
Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!

Phillip
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 

Kyle
Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!

Stan
I know! This is awesome!

Kyle
I'm so happy! 

Announcer
Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. 

Singer
So much sufferin'... 

Kyle
Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!

Stan
What?

Kyle
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 

Sarah McLachlan
These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.

Stan
Aw dude, that's so sad. 

Kyle
Why do they have to put this on TV?! 

Sarah McLachlan
Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless.  Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them.  Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you.

Stan
Awww dude, awwww.

Kyle
Aaaggh, God.

Sarah McLachlan
Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. 

Kyle
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 

Nurse
It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.

Kyle
What exactly can I do to help?

Nurse
Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.

Kyle
Oh it's, it's so sad.

Nurse
Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 

Cartman
Oh. Hey Kyle.

Kyle
What are you doing here?

Cartman
I'm volunteering.

Kyle
...What are you doing here?!

Cartman
I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.

Nurse
Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.

Kyle
Why do you have a video camera?

Cartman
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 

Ms. Williams
Bye, Eric. 

Kyle
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?

Ms. Williams
Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.

Kyle
Thanks. 

Kyle
What's going on?!

Butters
Wuuuuhhhhhh! 

Cartman
Ah, crap! 

Cartman
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.

Kyle
So what are you doing?!

Cartman
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.

Kyle
Alright, what is it?!

Cartman
Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!

Kyle
Why do you need me?

Cartman
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!

Kyle
I knew you were doing something terrible!

Cartman
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!

Kyle
Lots of people will when I tell them!

Cartman
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 

Kyle
You what?

Cartman
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.

Kyle
A thousand dollars.

Cartman
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.

Cartman
After you. 

Kyle
There's a big wait to sit down.

Waiter
Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.

Cartman
Come on. 

Cartman
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.

Kyle
Jesus Christ.

Craig
It's awesome.

Cartman
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.

Butters
Every single night.

Cartman
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.

Kyle
Wow...

Cartman
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.

Butters
I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now

Cartman
You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 

Cartman
Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.

Kyle
And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.

Cartman
Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 

Stan
Go long, Token! Go go! 

Kyle
Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.

Stan
Wow, really? 

Kyle
I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.

Stan
Doing what?

Kyle
Crack baby... basketball.

Stan
...Dude.

Kyle
No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?

Cartman
Betsy MacIntosh?

Betsy MacIntosh
Whatta you want?

Cartman
We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?

Betsy MacIntosh
Oh Gohhhd.

Cartman
We need to speak with you, ma'am. 

Betsy MacIntosh
It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.

Cartman
And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?

Betsy MacIntosh
I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! 

Cartman
Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 

Betsy MacIntosh
The what?

Cartman
We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?

Betsy MacIntosh
They said it's a boy.

Cartman
Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.

Betsy MacIntosh
How much will he make?

Cartman
Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.

Betsy MacIntosh
So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.

Cartman
I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-

Betsy MacIntosh
Cain't you change the rules?

Cartman
Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being. I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 

Kyle
Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 

Stan
...You sound like Cartmam.

Kyle
Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!

Stan
Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.

Kyle
I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 

Cartman
It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!

Clyde
We're just having a hard time finding him.

Cartman
Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.

Kyle
I need to talk to you. 

Cartman
Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?

Kyle
In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.

Cartman
They can't make money. It's against the rules.

Kyle
But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.

Cartman
Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.

Kyle
Gut they're the ones risking injury.

Cartman
What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!

Kyle
The government could come after us, Cartman.

Cartman
We're a non-profit company, Kyle.

Kyle
So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?

Cartman
Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 

Kyle
A hot tub?!

Cartman
It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 

Kyle
Gravy?

Cartman
Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.

Kyle
No way.

Cartman
A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this poutaine.

Kyle
I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.

Cartman
It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.

Kyle
What other companies?

Secretary
Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you.

Dean Howland
A what? Send him in. 

Cartman
Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.

Dean Howland
In the what?

Cartman
My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.

Dean Howland
I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.

Cartman
You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.

Dean Howland
Are you referring to our student athletes?

Cartman
Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- student atheletes then?

Dean Howland
Look, there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.

Cartman
I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?

Dean Howland
We do  not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.

Cartman
But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.

Dean Howland
Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!

Cartman
You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 

Kyle
Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!

Stan
McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?

Kyle
It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 

Cartman
How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!

Clyde
We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.

Cartman
How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!

Clyde
We don't know. He's everywhere.

Cartman
Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!

Craig
Oh, that's a good idea.

Cartman
Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!

Kyle
Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.

Cartman
...What?

Kyle
I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!

Cartman
Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!

Kyle
...What?

Cartman
This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our student athletes a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 

Postmaster
Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?

Craig
Please sir, it's very important.

Postmaster
Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids.

Clyde
But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.

Postmaster
Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here.  The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-

Postman
Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real. 

Roger
Hullo?

Clyde
Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?

Roger
Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.

Betsy
Oooo well, the day had to come.

Roger
Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?

Clyde
Slash isn't real.

Craig
Get out of here.

Betsy
Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh...

Roger
Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.

Clyde
He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.

Roger
Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?

Betsy
Vunter Slash kapunshka

Both Parents
Shpielerin manshunshka

Kyle
And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?

Clyde
You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 

Cartman
What?

Craig
Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.

Butters
Slash is make-believe??

Clyde
Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 

Cartman
Vunter Slash?

Kyle
What?

Cartman
But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?

Clyde
One of our parents.

Cartman
But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?

Clyde
One of our parents!

Cartman
Are you fucking serious? 

Stan
You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 

Cartman
You knew about this??

Stan
My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 

Butters
Well what the heck do we do now?

Kyle
Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!

Mr. Peters
Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih.

Kyle
Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.

Mr. Peters
Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. 

Kyle
You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!

Mr. Peters
Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. 

Cartman
I just can't believe Slash isn't real,

Butters
I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.

Kyle
You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!

Cartman
I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.

Mr. Peters
Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': Get the fuck out of my buildin'!

Kyle
It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!

Stan
It's what?

Kyle
This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?

Ms. Williams
Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.

Kyle
But who paid for all this? 

Stan
Kyle, Kyle! Look. 

Kyle
You don't think that-? But he isn't real.

Stan
Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.

Child singers

Tuong Lu Kim

Butters
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.

Tuong Lu Kim
A what? Ret me see that!  Oh no, a sushi prace? How come every time a hard-working Chinese man open a business, some shmelly Japanese dog has to come and try invade him?!

Butters
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.

Tuong Lu Kim
Where is this Japanese-uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!

Butters

Tuong Lu Kim
What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!

Mr. Takiyama

Steven
Hello?

Sgt. Yates
Sir, does this mailman belong to you?

Stephen
That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?

Sgt. Yates
There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.

Stephen
What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!

Butters
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-

Stephen
Don't talk back to me! 

Sgt. Yates
We'll send a bill for the damages,  but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? 

Stephen
Go up to your room, now! 

Linda
What's going on?

Stephen
Butters started an Asian turf war!

Linda
Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?

Stephen
I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.

Stephen
Well Dr. Janus?

Dr. Janus
I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.

Linda
What?

Dr. Janus
There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named Postman Butters and yet another is Fireman Butters. And then there's even Inspector Butters and uh, Professor Chaos.

Linda
Oh my God!

Dr. Janus
From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.

Linda
Oh, poor Butters!

Stephen
Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?

Dr. Janus
No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point.  What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.

Field Reporter
Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area Little Tokyo.

Tuong Lu Kim
What the fuuuck?!  You see what happen?!

Mr. Takiyama
I told you not to come in here!

Tuong Lu Kim
Now everyone in town think a Chinese and a Japanese are the same fucking thing!

Mr. Takiyama
I don't even know what the fuck you are saying! Uhpupuh putuh peepee!

Tuong Lu Kim
Aaah you Japanese racist! 

Linda
Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters!  Look!

Butters
Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!

Linda
Now he thinks he's a truck driver. 

Stephen
Oh God the medication isn't working!

Butters
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 

Stephen
Butters! Butters!!  BUTTERRRRS!

Butters
Oh hey Dad.

Stephen
You're back. You're back-he's back!  I love you son!

Butters
I love you too, Dad.

Stephen
You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! 

Mr. Takiyama
Youuu, get out! I told you not to come in here!

Tuong Lu Kim
Okay, whoa, just hold a minute, hold a minute. I come ina peace.

Mr. Takiyama
I don't berieve you!

Tuong Lu Kim
Come on, rook! All this fighting, it's just to sirry, you know? Chinese anda Japanese been fighting for so rong. It'sa ridicurous. What we need... is to have a tweaty.

Mr. Takiyama
What is tweaty?

Tuong Lu Kim
Nono, we need a tweaty.

Mr. Takiyama
A tweaty?

Tuong Lu Kim
No, not a treaty, a tweaty!

Mr. Takiyama
Oh, you mean a treaty?

Tuong Lu Kim
What the fuck is a tweaty?

Mr. Takiyama
No no, a treaty.

Tuong Lu Kim
A tweaty?  Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference. You know, so they know fried rice isn't from Japan and teriyaki isn't from China.

Customer
Teriyaki isn't from China?

Tuong Lu Kim
No, teriyaki isn't froma fucking China!

Mr. Takiyama
Very well. I will do assembly with you.

Tuong Lu Kim
Oh really? Oh great.  Okay, I'll meet you tomorrow and we can go over our prans.  And when you get to that assembry, you gonna get big surprise, you Japanese dog.

Dr. Janus
Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?

Butters
Sure.

Dr. Janus
What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?

Butters
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.

Dr. Janus
You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?

Butters
Sure.

Dr. Janus
I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.

Butters
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.

Dr. Janus
Inspector Butters, what do you want?

Butters
Uh, well, to solve mysteries.

Dr. Janus
And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?

Butters
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!

Dr. Janus
He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?

Butters
What? Why would I do that?

Dr. Janus
Who am I speaking to now?

Butters
Me, Butters.

Dr. Janus
Ah, Butters. You're back.

Butters
Sir, I'm confused.

Dr. Janus
I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.

Butters
Really?

Dr. Janus
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.

Alias 1
Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.

Butters
Pardon me?

Alias 1
He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.

Dr. Janus
Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.

Psycho Janus
Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!

Dr. Janus
Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?

Billy
Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!

Psycho Janus
Your soul will bleed for eternity!

Alias 2
You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison.

Alias 3
That Big Red freshness lasts right through it!

Alias 4
The horned toad says we should go to Mexico. 

Dr. Janus
What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?

Butters
Yes!

Butters
This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.

Butters
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.

Butters
Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.

Butters
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 

Butters
Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!

Butters
Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!

Mr. Mackey
Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about the diversity of Asian people. Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. 

Tuong Lu Kim
Ni hao ma, South Park Erementary?!

Mr. Takiyama
Konnichiwa?!

Tuong Lu Kim
How are we arr feering?!  Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?

Mr. Takiyama
Oh, rearry?  Hey, that ruhight. If you ook at map, you can see.

Tuong Lu Kim
This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!

Mr. Takiyama
What?!

Tuong Lu Kim
The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!

Mr. Takiyama
Fuck you!

Tuong Lu Kim
Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!

Dr. Janus
Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.

Butters
Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?

Dr. Janus
Yes. did you catch something?

Butters
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.

Dr. Janus
Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!

Butters
Huh?

Dr. Janus
What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!

Butters
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-

Dr. Janus
Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!

Dr. Janus
Get in there! Move it, asshole!

Butters
This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!

Dr. Janus
They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it!  Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are!   Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!

Butters
I'm trying, sir! 

Dr. Janus
Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!

Butters
What?

Dr. Janus
Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!

Butters
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...

Dr. Janus
Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal.

Dr. Janus
We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.

Sgt. Yates
Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.

Steven
Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!

Sgt. Yates
Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.

Steven
Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.

Tuong Lu Kim
Herro-o.

Mr. Takiyama
You get the fuck out of my place!

Tuong Lu Kim
Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?

Mr. Takiyama
Get the fuck out before I call police!

Tuong Lu Kim
Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha recial stereotypes. Prease.

Mr. Takiyama
Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.

Tuong Lu Kim
Okay, see you tomorrow.  And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. 

Butters
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 

Dr. Janus
Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help!  Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem!  The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!

Butters
Um, excuse me?

Dr. Janus
No no nonono! Don't call out for help!  He's got a gun.

Butters
Wahh!

Dr. Janus
If you draw any attention he'll kill us!

Butters
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.

Dr. Janus
No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.

Butters
What??

Dr. Janus
You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.

Butters
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!

Dr. Janus
You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please!

The owner of Shitty Wok has actually paid for what he calls a tower of peace.  to symbolize harmony between the two restaurants
